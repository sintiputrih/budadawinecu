The next year, he was committed to a mental health facility and then went to another sober living facility in Jacksonville Beach. That’s when he was kicked out for fighting in June.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Investigators said Pringle, who was presumably headed home after stopping by her workplace at Dos Gatos bar downtown, was driving down Hendricks Avenue when she was forced to stop her white SUV because of a passing train around 1:40 a.m. Aug. 9.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Pringle was a beloved employee at the popular Dos Gatos bar in downtown Jacksonville, which is only about 2 miles from the train tracks.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">News4JAX spoke to one of Pringle’s co-workers who said that before she left the lounge, she told him that a customer was giving her a weird vibe. While it’s unclear if Head was the customer she was referring to, police said they used cell phone tracking to determine that he followed her from her job.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Retired JSO Director Tom Hackney said this was an unusual circumstance.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">“You usually have some kind of connection between your victim and your suspect. They know each other or are somehow acquainted. In this case, if this is true, this is something that’s not even random. It’s targeted for her by somebody who may have been infatuated by her,” he said.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB"><b>Related: </b><b>911 callers describe the scene after two women were killed in San Marco</b><b> | </b><b>‘Everyone’s shocked’: Sheriff says JSO searching for answers after 2 women gunned down near San Marco train tracks</b></p><figure class="sc-dkzDqf dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-5 gQyjmp eeCpcl full-width" id=TINHR7KKD5FABAS4HTDZDDFLEY><span class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 kGduZK">Paige Pringle, 28, and Tara Baker, 53, were killed in a double shooting early in the morning on Aug. 9, 2023.</span><span class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gXaOYT"> (WJXT)</span></figure><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Surveillance video showed also Head’s gray Volkswagen Passat driving behind Pringle down Hendricks Avenue just before the shooting.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">For reasons investigators do not know, Head got out of his car and shot Baker, who was standing next to her bicycle near the train tracks, waiting for it to pass first. Then he shot Pringle as she sat in her vehicle, causing her SUV to coast forward and strike the passing train.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">The two women did not know each other, and police searched Head’s laptop but found nothing connecting Head to Pringle or Baker.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">A day after the shooting, Head was found dead with the same gun he used to kill Pringel and Baker in his hand. His autopsy revealed there weren’t any drugs in his system.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">The report said Head’s mother gave him more than $2,000 to help him get by after he was kicked out of the sober living facility, but the two argued. She told police that he was acting irrationally.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">JSO went to talk to him at his job the day before the double murders on Aug. 8. JSO said he appeared lucid and told the officers that he was not a threat to himself or others. Instead, he was upset with his mother.</p><p>Copyright 2023 by WJXT News4JAX – All rights reserved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno528sMDEq2Sipl2orq95zJqpnKddmby2rsueZKatopmys3nLnp6apJyuerHB0ZyfmquVmXqowc1mm56roJ7BpnnDqJqupZWjwaawjKacp6yRoXqpscClq6FlmJ7AtbvRsmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./richard-pryor-heart-attacks-live-in-concert-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Comedy Perfection of Richard Pryors Heart Attacks">&larr;
