You may read more about his family and wealth in this article. As Anil “The Vocalist” Bheem, Anil Bheem was a well-known musician and radio host.</strong></p><p>After 48 years, he passed away. Along with singing and RJing, Anil was the founder and boss of The BMRZ Empire. Anil gained prominence in the 1990s as the host of Chutney Train, the most popular Indian programme in the country that airs on Saturday mornings.</p><h2><span id=Obituary_And_Death_Notice_For_Anil_Bheem_What_Happened_To_The_Vocalist>Obituary And Death Notice For Anil Bheem: What Happened To The Vocalist?</span></h2><p>Anil Bheem’s passing was announced by radio station 103.1 FM via a Facebook post on February 4, 2023. The singer passed away following performances at two pre-Carnival concerts, according to the Trinidad Express. His death was reported by his employer, 103.1fm, in a Facebook post at around 6.20 a.m.</p><p>The real reason for Bheem’s passing has not yet been revealed in the media, though. His admirers and observers believe heart failure was a major reason because he passed away following his performances. The Vocalist had two performances before he passed away: one at a gathering in Chaguanas and the other at Rig Restaurant in La Romaine for 103.1fm Fenomenal Fridays.</p><h2><span id=Meet_the_Bheem_family_including_Anil8217s_wife_Cheryl>Meet the Bheem family, including Anil’s wife Cheryl</span></h2><p>Cheryl Bheem was the name of Anil’s wife. Anil has shielded his family from public view. Because of this, virtually little is known about his family. He is survived by his mother Pramatee Bheem, wife Cheryl, daughters Neelun Bheem and Prithivi Bheem, as well as grandchildren.</p><p>We deliver the news that our dear Anil Bheem died away this morning with sorrowful hearts, and they are still processing it, 103.1 FM tweeted. The radio station sent its condolences to his wife Cheryl, daughters, family, friends, coworkers in the business, and supporters. Reportedly, Prematee Bheem, a well-known local singer, is Anil’s mother, and during his free time, her son used to practise singing at the studio. According to reports, the singer passed away on February 4 at his house in Curepe, the morning following a performance the previous evening.</p><p>Anil Bheem began his professional life in 1993 as a technical operator at 103FM, Trinidad and Tobago’s first station dedicated exclusively to Indian music. Typically, Kumar Sanu, India’s renowned playback singer, served as the vocalist for Anil’s renditions of popular Bollywood songs.</p><h2><span id=Value_of_Anil_Bheem_at_the_Time_of_His_Death>Value of Anil Bheem at the Time of His Death</span></h2><p>As of 2023, Anil Bheem’s net worth is anticipated to be at <strong>$1 million.</strong> The radio host worked at 103.1 FM in the afternoons and hosted the well-liked drivetime program Catch the Rhythms. He recently gave a performance of Suhani Raat Dhal Chuki, a popular song in the area by Mohammed Rafi and called The Indian Anthem, with his band, the BMRZ. The average gross income in Trinidad and Tobago is $99,416 per year, or $48 per hour, according to pay experts.</p><h2><span id=What_Caused_Anil_Bheem8217s_Death>What Caused Anil Bheem’s Death?</span></h2><p>We now know that a priceless soul died on February 4. The songs and work of Anil Bheem have touched many hearts. He tragically passed away at age 48. As soon as Anil’s passing was confirmed by his employer at 103.1fm, the news spread. Others found it hard to accept and were curious as to what could have possibly killed such a happy person so suddenly.</p><p>Even though Anil’s passing was widely reported, no one knew what contributed to it. But current reliable sources indicate that a heart attack was the likely cause of his sudden demise. Since the musician was balancing a busy schedule on the day of his passing, many people had previously had the same belief.</p><p>As a result of being overworked, Anile passed away. According to News Day, Anil’s funeral will be held on Thursday at 9 a.m. at the Divali Nagar location of the National Council of Indian Culture in Chaguanas. Consequently, the occasion happened on Thursday, February 9. Many close friends and family members of Anil came to his funeral. A video of the event that is almost six hours long has also been posted on YouTube.</p><h2><span id=Anil_bheem8217s_Wife8217s_Tribute_At_His_Funeral_Cheryl_Bheem>Anil bheem’s Wife’s Tribute At His Funeral, Cheryl Bheem</span></h2><p>During Anil Bheem’s funeral, a lot of people discussed the legend, and his widow also paid respect to her late husband. In her speech, Cheryl made reference to Anil’s father, Krishna Bheem. The late actor was the brother of the twins Vimy, Navin, and Devi Bheem, she further revealed. Zaya, Ruhi, and Raees were the late icon’s three grandchildren, according to Cheryl.</p><p>Anil’s wife noted in her eulogy that despite leading a busy professional life, the late singer loved and made time for his family. However, Anil’s spouse described how much the late singer cherished his two dogs, Gucci and Sushi. Anil used to enjoy playing with them, and he enjoyed having pets.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Taylor Kitsch Doesn&#39;t Have Time To Date Or Wed"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/taylor-kitsch-doesnt-have-time-to-date-or-wed/"}{"1":57}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Vocalist</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Bronson Varde</a></h3>Bronson Varde- Biography Bronson Varde is a well-known American vocalist.
