Meet Timothy Laurence – Anne, Princess Royal is the second child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.</strong></p><p>She was born on 15th August 1950, and is 16th in the line of succession to the British throne. Anne is the only sister of King Charles III, and has been Princess Royal since 1987.</p><p>Princess Anne received her early education from her governess, Catherine Peebles, at Buckingham Palace. She did not attend her mother’s coronation in June 1953 due to her young age. In May 1959, a Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace Company, was re-formed, so Anne could socialise with girls her age. The company was active until 1963, after which Anne enrolled at Benenden School. She left school in 1968 with six GCE O-Levels and two A-Levels, and began to undertake royal engagements in 1969.</p><p>Princess Anne became a respected equestrian, winning one gold medal in 1971 and two silver medals in 1975 at the European Eventing Championships. In 1976, she became the first member of the British royal family to compete in the Olympic Games. In 1988, she became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</p><p>Princess Anne performs official duties and engagements on behalf of the King. She is patron or president of over 300 organisations, including WISE, Riders for Health, and Carers Trust. Her work in charities centres on sports, sciences, people with disabilities, and health in developing countries. She has been associated with Save the Children for over fifty years and has visited a number of its projects.</p><p>In 1970, Anne briefly had a relationship with Andrew Parker Bowles, who later married Camilla Shand. Camilla later became the second wife and queen consort of Anne’s eldest brother, Charles III. Anne was also briefly linked to Olympic equestrian Richard Meade.</p><p>On 20th March 1974, Princess Anne and Mark Phillips were returning to Buckingham Palace from a charity event when a Ford Escort forced their Princess IV car to stop on The Mall. The driver of the Escort, Ian Ball, jumped out and began firing a pistol.</p><p>Inspector James Beaton, Anne’s personal police officer, exited the car to shield her and to try to disarm Ball. Beaton’s firearm jammed, and he was shot by Ball, as was Anne’s chauffeur, Alex Callender, when he tried to disarm Ball. Brian McConnell, a nearby tabloid journalist, also intervened and was shot in the chest.</p><p>Ball approached Anne’s car and told her that he intended to kidnap her and hold her for ransom. Princess Anne replied, “Not bloody likely!” Princess Anne reportedly briefly considered hitting Ball. Eventually, Anne exited the other side of the limousine, as had her lady-in-waiting, Rowena Brassey.</p><p>A passing pedestrian, a former boxer named Ron Russell, punched Ball and led Anne away from the scene.</p><p>At that point, Police Constable Michael Hills happened upon the scene; he too was shot by Ball, but he had already called for police backup. Detective Constable Peter Edmonds answered, gave chase, and finally arrested Ball.</p><p>Beaton, Hills, Callender, and McConnell were hospitalised, and recovered from their wounds. For his defence of Princess Anne, Beaton was awarded the George Cross by the Queen, who was visiting Indonesia when the incident occurred; Hills and Russell were awarded the George Medal, and Callender, McConnell, and Edmonds were awarded the Queen’s Gallantry Medal.</p><p>It was widely reported that the Queen paid off Russell’s mortgage, but this is not true. Anne visited Beaton in the hospital and thanked him for his assistance. In 1983, she spoke about the event</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Princess Anne’s Husband? Meet Timothy Laurence</h2><p>In 1968, Anne met Mark Phillips, a lieutenant in the 1st Queen’s Dragoon Guards, at a party for horse enthusiasts. They got engaged on May 29, 1973, and got married on November 14, 1973, at Westminster Abbey in a televised ceremony that attracted an estimated audience of 100 million.</p><p>The couple settled at Gatcombe Park, and declined the customary earldom offered to untitled men marrying into the royal family. As a result, their children were born without titles. Anne and Mark had two children, Peter (born 1977) and Zara Phillips (born 1981), and five grandchildren.</p><p>In August 1989, Anne and Mark announced their intention to separate, and although they initially shared custody of their children and stated that there were no plans for divorce, Anne filed for divorce on April 13, 1992, and it was finalized ten days later.</p><p>In early 1989, Anne met Timothy Laurence, a commander in the Royal Navy, while he was serving on the Royal Yacht Britannia. They developed a relationship, and in December 1992, they got married at Crathie Kirk near Balmoral Castle in Scotland.</p><p>Approximately 30 guests attended the private ceremony, and unlike the Church of England, the Church of Scotland permitted the remarriage of divorced individuals under certain circumstances. Anne became the first royal divorcée to remarry since Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Queen Victoria’s granddaughter.</p><p>Anne wore a white jacket over a cropped-to-the-knee dress and a spray of white flowers in her hair for the wedding ceremony, and her engagement ring was a cabochon sapphire flanked by three small diamonds on each side. Timothy Laurence did not receive a peerage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqxvsinmp6ro2Kur7rErGShraOXrq%2BwjK2gpqekncZuuMCuqZ6mk5p8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./21-savage-removes-face-tattoos-shocks-fans-ink-gone.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="21 Savage Removes Face Tattoos &amp;amp; Shocks Fans  Ink Gone For Good?
