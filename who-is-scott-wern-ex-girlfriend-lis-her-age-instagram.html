Scott reconciled with his ex-Lis following his separation from 90 Day Fiancé alum Lidia Morel, the mother of Pedro Jimeno.</p><p>Fans of 90-Day learned about Scott and Lis on the season three premiere of Love in Paradise on May 27, 2023. Nicole Jimeno, Lidia’s daughter, joined Lidia and Scott at the table and inquired about Scott’s Colombian ex-girlfriend. Nicole and Lidia were astonished when Scott said that Lis was the same age as his daughter: 29. Scott was 51 years old and Lidia was 56 years old at the time.</p><p>“What is he doing with me?” Lidia asked.</p><p>Additionally, Scott disclosed that Lis ghosted him after he gave her pricey presents. Nicole asserted that she did not think Lis “was in love with him” and that she merely dated him for financial gain. Nicole charged Scott with lying about talking to Lis during the June 5 show.</p><p>“All suspicions I had about you are true,” Nicole said. “You are talking with your ex-girlfriend, Colombian, when you, you told me, ‘Oh no, I don’t have any communication with her.’ You are a bulls–tter, you are a liar.”</p><p>As shown on the June 19, 2023, episode of Love in Paradise, Scott and Lis reunited for a romantic holiday in Puerto Plata that he had initially booked for Lidia shortly after their romance ended. Lis acknowledged that she and Scott had chemistry during their first relationship and that she thought he was “charming.” Lis was “freaked” out when Scott started talking about marriage with her.</p><p>As he started dating Lidia, they remained in touch, but Lis wanted Scott back and was overjoyed when he proposed a meeting.</p><p>Lis apologized to Scott for hurting him during a tearful hug. Lis said in the short clip that when they were dating she found Scott very charming. She added, “I think we got that click.”</p><p>But, Scott started talking about marriage and it freaked her out. The pair broke up.</p><p>“I’m just happy that you’re here,” Scott told her. “I just don’t want to lose you again.”</p><p>When Lis checked her old email, Scott had sent messages to her for one and a half years.</p><p>Scott and Lis seem to be still dating. By uploading pictures and a video of them having supper on June 14, he made their relationship Instagram official. Since then, Scott has shared Lis a few more times, including a throwback clip from two and a half years ago in which he appears to have told Lis for the first time that he loved her after paying her a visit in Cali, Colombia.</p><p>Scott’s smile beamed, she gasped and kissed him on the cheek.</p><h3><strong>Scott Wern Ex-Girlfriend Lis Age</strong></h3><p>Lis, the ex-girlfriend of Scott Wern, appears to be under 37 years of age as of 2023.
