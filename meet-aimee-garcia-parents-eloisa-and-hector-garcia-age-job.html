Keep scrolling down to his article to learn more about the folks.</p><p>We got it all covered so keep scrolling.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Actress Aimee Garcia Parents?</strong></h3><p>Aimee Sandimés Garcia López de Ordóez was born to a Puerto Rican father Hector and a Mexican mother Eloisa in Chicago, Illinois. Her parents went to the cubs game for their first date and tied the knot three months later. <span>The actress claimed in an interview with Gozamos that, although daily acknowledging the importance of education, getting Hollywood jobs has been made easier for her due to her heritage.</span></p><p>Aimee stated, “Being Latin has helped me. I was on the George Lopez show and have been able to play Andy Garcia’s daughter. This wouldn’t have happened if I weren’t Latin. On ‘Supernatural’ I got to play Irish, Nancy Fitzgerald… In ‘Lost in America,’ if I weren’t bilingual and completely fluent in Spanish, I wouldn’t have gotten to go to Hawaii and share the screen with Zach Gilford from ‘Friday Night Lights.'”</p><p>Additionally, Aimee also shared, “I am a proud product of my immigrant parents’ American dream. She then added, “I am Puerto Rican. I am Mexican. I am American, I Am Latina.”</p><p>Her family’s financial status wasn’t that great. Her parents ensured she and her brother went to the best schools they could afford.</p><p>Aimee admitted to Gozamos that although she didn’t know what or where college was at the age of four, she was certain that she would attend it one day. She added, “My dad went to college but his parents didn’t speak much English but my grandmother always said that I was going to college. I remember being four years old and going to college. I didn’t even know what college was.”</p><p>She added, “I didn’t know if it was a restaurant or a country! I just knew I was going.”</p><p>The actress began performing as a child in commercials before joining the theater when she was seven years old. Aimee studied acting at Piven Theatre Workshop while still in high school (Fenwick High School) and then performed in regional plays and musicals while attending college.</p><p>French, journalism, and economics were Garcia’s three majors at Northwestern University. She gave up performing for a year after graduating and worked as a financial analyst for a mutual fund in Brooklyn, New York. That didn’t last long, though, as Aimee soon went to Los Angeles, California, to pursue an acting career because she was dissatisfied with her employment.</p><h3><strong>Meet Eloisa Garcia, Aimee Garcia Mother</strong></h3><p><img alt=Aimee-Garcia-Mom width=300 height=290 data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Aimee-Garcia-Mom-300x290.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Eloisa Garcia is the mother of Aimee Garcia who hailed from Pachuca, Mexico. She shared about her mother’s upbringing in PopSugar.</p><p>Aimee added, “My grandfather had holes in his socks, but somehow found a way to put my mom in piano classes. He and my grandmother believed a good education would give their kids choices. And, they were right.”</p><p>For her blog on Popsugar, Aimee asked Eloise if she loved the U.S. Eloisa replied, “In the United States, you can be whomever you are… you can clean bathrooms, you can be friends, you can be a doctor. This country appreciates everyone.”</p><p>Eloisa came to the US at 26 years old. And, when I asked her what she loved about this country recently, she said, “In the United States, you can be whomever you are . . . you can clean bathrooms, you can be a friend, you can be a doctor. This country appreciates everyone. It’s not a class system. It’s a place where anything is possible. I’m very happy that I came here. I’m blessed. What else can I ask for?”</p><p>On Mother’s Day 2019, Aimee wished her mom via an IG post. She wrote, “Ma, thx for being my rock! You are a trailblazing badass who always taught me to create the change you wanna see, laugh hard, never stop learning, and to ALWAYS have tequila in the house in case familia or friends come over 🥃🥃 Eres mi mundo ma. Te amo muchisimo!!! HAPPY MOTHERS DAY … Love you ma.”</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Eloisa Garcia Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Born in 1949, Eloisa Garcia is 73 years old.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Eloisa Garcia Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Eloisa Garcia D.D.S. and M.S. is currently working as an <a href=#>orthodontist</a> in Chicago. She graduated top of her class in Mexico and that gave her the opportunity to attend graduate school in the US. She became the first Latina to graduate from Northwestern University’s Dental School, even though she came to this country with less-than-perfect English. In fact, she was the only two girls in her entire dental program.</p><p>Eloisa told PopSugar, “I couldn’t understand the full lecture right away, so the school gave me permission to tape-record the lectures. That way, I could listen to them when I got home and translate them before I started studying. I cannot complain. I worked my whole life, I was so busy doing the schoolwork.”</p><p>She added, “I was in school from 7 am to 10 pm. No time to complain.”</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Eloisa Garcia On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, Eloisa Garcia is on Instagram (<a href=#>@dreloisagarcia</a>).</p><h3><strong>Meet Hector Garcia, Aimee Garcia Father</strong></h3><p>Aimee Garcia’s father Hector Garcia hailed from Puerto Rico. But, he was born in San Juan to a poor family. The family moved to the Fort Sheridan military base in Chicago. They didn’t even have indoor plumbing! So, his grandfather joined the military to give his kids a better life.</p><p>After schlepping from France (where her grandfather was stationed) to Missouri, the family settled in the Fort Sheridan military base in Chicago. And, even though her grandmother was reluctant to speak English (because she was embarrassed of her thick accent), she always told her kids, “You’re going to college.”</p><p>“I was a fairly shy and introverted kid, but I had my close-knit buddies. My best friend was this African American kid named Joshua. We were in accelerated classes, so I guess we were ‘nerds.'” Hector told Aimee. When Aimee asked Hector what he thought this country had offered him, he said, “It has provided many opportunities. My dad joining the military opened up many doors for us to get a great education in Chicago and go to college.”</p><p>On Father’s Day 2022, Aimee wished her dad, “Happy Father’s Day dad! I’ll never stop trying to be like you 😹 And Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there!! We love you guys.”</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Hector Garcia Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>In March 2023, Hector Garcia is 71 years old.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Hector Garcia Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Hector Garcia grew up learning English and working as a gardener, busboy, dishwasher, and newspaper boy to pay for his school supplies.
