Similarly, he is currently <strong>62 years old</strong> and his nationality is Dutch-Canadian. Moving on, he follows Christianity while his birth sign is Sagittarius.</p><p>Moving on to his family, he was born to Klaun Beets and Magda Beets, his father, and mother. In the same way, he has a sister named Minnie Beets.</p><p>When Tony was seven years old, his family relocated to Burgwerd, Canada. He grew up on his family’s huge farm. After his father became ill, he took over the family farm and was in charge of workers who were significantly older than he was.</p><p>Tony claims that becoming the boss at an early age inspired him to either equal or better his employees and that throughout his life, he had always been trusted with the top job in a short period, which kept him one step ahead.</p><p>In terms of his education, the actor has never divulged the names of the institutions or the degrees he has earned.</p><h2><span id=Tony_Beets_8211_Personal_Life>Tony Beets – Personal Life</span></h2><p>When Tony Beets and his wife <strong>Minnie Beets</strong> first started dating, they lived next door to each other. His wife was just 20 years old at the time, but they had been dating for a long time before being married in 1984 and moving to Canada with her.</p><p>Their marriage, which has lasted decades, has produced five children, the youngest of whom, Jasmine, was born in 1992 but died after just a few months, and the others, Monica, Michale, Kelvin, and Bianca, all of whom work in the family company.</p><p>Their marriage looks to be rock strong, as they have not spoken divorce or separation in many years. Minnie is also a vital part of her husband’s business since she manages the finances as well as the paperwork.</p><p>Before her position as the bookkeeper at Paradise Hill, which she has managed professionally for more than a decade, Minnie worked in-home nursing after she and her husband relocated to Canada.</p><p>She currently has a tight grip on the family company’s purse strings, since she frequently quarrels with her husband about the vast sums of money he invests in the dredge.</p><p>They’ve been together for over four decades and are still going strong. They have a home in Arizona where they live.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-184533 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tony-with-his-wife.jpg alt="Tony Beets" width=650 height=672 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-184533 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Tony with his wife (source: Liverampup)</p><h2><span id=Tony_Beets_8211_Professional_Life_and_Career>Tony Beets – Professional Life and Career</span></h2><p>Tony has worked as a farmer, a machine operator, and on oil pipelines throughout his career.
