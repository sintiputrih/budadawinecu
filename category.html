I find that Thanksgiving hosts often like to have a special option for vegetarians at their table, especially if they are newer to the family. But what people don’t know is that, for the most part, herbivores are usually just as happy to fill up on stuffing, mashed potatoes, acorn squash, roasted veggies, pumpkin pie, and more. So this year, my “main dish” is doubling as a side dish. Instead of making giant acorn squash halves stuffed with everything and the kitchen sink, leaving me way…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Skip pumpkin pie this Thanksgiving, and make butternut squash pudding instead! This yummy pudding is creamy and oh so pumpkin-like, but it’s made with fresh roasted squash. It’s super easy to make – just roast butternut squash, blend, and chill. Here’s how this one came about. A few weeks ago, I made these butternut sandwiches, and multiple tests of this butternut curry. By the end of that week, I had lots of squash parts leftover (particularly because those sandwiches required just the long plank pieces). My first thought, of course, was to make soup. My second thought was to ask…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This pomegranate salad recipe is the perfect way to add a little color to any fall or winter meal. As we approach Thanksgiving, I feel like foods become more and more brown. I know – we all love cheesy, bready things, but if I’ve found one calling in life (er.. in blog-life), it’s to find and bring forth the colorful foods of every season. Here, I pack as many as I can into one stunning salad. This pomegranate salad has apples and squash, onions and greens, carrots and kohlrabi, and pomegranates, of course! We flipping love pomegranates. They add vibrancy…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy post-Halloween! I hope you all had a fantastic holiday. Ours was… I guess you could say, a little low key. We worked late and then went to the bar at Whole Foods for drinks and dinner. Because these types of activities are actually really fun when you’re an old married couple like we are :). Another thing that’s fun for us – pasta! But not just any pasta – spicy butternut squash pasta! I’ve been on a butternut squash kick lately, see here and here. For this post, I had originally planed to make a more traditional fall pasta…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This pumpkin French toast is the perfect fall breakfast! It’s crisp and golden brown on the outside, moist and tender in the middle, and packed with pumpkin flavor the whole way through. It’s super easy to make, so you could whip it up on a weekday, but I especially love it on the weekends, when I can sit back, relax, and savor it. Just like it does in baking recipes, pumpkin puree makes a great egg replacer in this recipe, creating a rich, custard-like mixture to coat the thick slices of bread. As a result, this pumpkin French toast is…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Once fall hits, I always crave two things: roasted sweet potatoes and chili. So naturally, I had sweet potato chili on my mind, but what I really wanted were big, puffy roasted sweet potato&nbsp;wedges and their deliciously sweet and browned caramelized edges. And that’s when it occurred to me – Sweet Potato Chili Fries! Well… wedges, technically. It’s the best of both worlds, and these little individual servings, topped with a quick slaw and avocado, are so fun to eat! I started with my favorite veggie chili recipe, which happens to be very quick and easy to make. Since there…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This sandwich is, quite simply, fall between bread. It’s stacked with roasted planks of butternut squash, a layer of thinly sliced apple, white cheddar cheese, rosemary, cranberries, arugula, and red cabbage that I quickly marinated in a little apple cider vinegar. It’s like one of those next-day leftover Thanksgiving sandwiches… that is, if you had a really colorful Thanksgiving. I made these last Sunday when the leaves were falling, the sun was out, and the air was crisp. I don’t know if it’s that cozy fall chill in the air, but suddenly we’re eating more grains with our meals –…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This coconut curry recipe is everything I want on a weeknight. Scratch that –&nbsp;it’s everything I want… any time. I’ve been eating it as leftovers for lunch, dinner… I even ate a bowlful for breakfast the other day. The recipe is particularly Monday night-friendly because it’s quick to make yet packs a punch of flavor. It’s filled with cozy, nourishing vegetables that will help you recover from a weekend of maybe… I dunno… too much pumpkin cake? The ingredient shot above makes this recipe look more complicated than it actually is. Once you’ve chopped the vegetables and measured the spices,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>You know how much I love chickpeas, and you know how much I love hummus, but today I’m going out of my chickpea comfort zone with this red lentil hummus recipe! It’s creamy, tangy, and nicely spiced with turmeric and other curry spices, because sometimes you run out of chickpeas, but you still want a dippable snack. We’ve been enjoying this lentil hummus with veggies, naan, pita chips… I’ve also been caught sneaking spoonfuls straight from the fridge. Red Lentil Hummus Ingredients Don’t let this ingredient list intimidate you – it’s all spices – hopefully you have most of them…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Until I tried this yellow split pea soup from Gena Hamshaw’s cookbook Power Plates, I didn’t think split peas were something to get excited about. I’d only ever had them when I was growing up, in classic split pea soup. You know, the kind that’s cooked with chicken stock and a ham hock and that’s really not my thing. This recipe takes the best parts of that traditional soup – smoky flavor, tons of plant-based protein – and heads in a totally new direction. It’s 100% vegan, sweet and savory, creamy, cozy, and totally delicious. If you’ve never cooked with…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These vegan pumpkin pancakes are just one of the many pumpkin recipes I’ve been making lately… mostly because when you open a can of pumpkin (or make your own pumpkin puree), there’s always some left over. I think that’s the true reason why people are so pumpkin-crazy in the fall. If you start with vegan pumpkin pancakes, you might as well go ahead and make pumpkin bars… and then, well, maybe some pumpkin cookies. After all, you have to use it up!&nbsp;(She says while eating said cookie.) Anyway, I’ve had so many requests for vegan pumpkin pancakes, and this recipe…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJno5qutLvNmqNoqJGcsnCFjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bella-thorne.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bella Thorne- Bio, Age, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Career">&larr;
