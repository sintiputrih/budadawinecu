Since the breaking news dropped, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenya Moore broke her silence on the platform formally known as Twitter</a>, posting, "#TEAMTWIRLFOREVER You are the best fans anyone could ever ask for. and I love you all so very much. Always and forever." Despite denying her actions on social media, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenya Moore has been accused of "revenge porn."</a><strong>The Real Housewives</strong> franchise as a whole has never been shy of having controversy. Between physical altercations, arrests, and jail time galore, rarely have any cast member received the punishment that Kenya has. The question now becomes, is it far? Is Bravo exposing a double standard when it comes to their personalities? <strong>Future Bravolebrities should be on high alert that future misconduct will not end well for them.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kenya Moore first joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Atlanta during Season 5 and has remained with the show since, with a one-season break during Season 11. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rising to stardom as "the villain everyone hates,"</a><strong>Kenya Moore has had quite a controversial run on the show</strong>, as well as on other reality programs she has appeared on. With credits such as <strong>The Celebrity Apprentice</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Dancing with the Stars</strong> </a>under her belt, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenya had another alleged incident on the set of <strong>The Worst Cooks in America</strong> following her elimination</a>.

Whether for the camera or simply that's just her personality, Kenya Moore has clashed with many of her cast mates. But what housewife in The Real Housewives Cinematic Universe doesn't? Whether it's pulling a prop like a clack fan or a bullhorn at a reunion, she's acknowledged that she's the shadiest of them all. By clashing with her costars, she's established herself as a terror that happens to just make some excellent television moments. But the latest alleged incident truly reached the edge. <strong>Exposing indecent images of another person as potential retaliation is truly uncalled for.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-10-baddest-villains-on-the-real-housewives-ranked.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The 10 Baddest Villains on 'The Real Housewives,' Ranked">The 10 Baddest Villains on 'The Real Housewives,' Ranked</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>These cast members don't play nice!</p><p>Where things get messy about horrid conduct, it's also happened to occur on The Real Housewives of Atlanta before. And involved Kenya Moore. During the filming of the Season 6 reunion, a feuding <a href=#><strong>Porsha Williams</strong></a> leaped off the couch and knocked Kenya over, taking down host <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> in the process. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The incident led to her being sent home from filming and a Kenya pressing charges, resulting in a charge of misdemeanor battery.</a> While she may have been demoted to "Friend of" for two seasons, Porsha's presence was still there. Had this incident occurred today, in light of the recent decision involving Kenya, <strong>Porsha may not have been welcomed back to the program for good.</strong> This is not a tit-for-tat situation. Neither incident should be condoned, but how they've been handled deserves to be scrutinized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-other-39-real-housewives-39-stars-been-fired-for-their-incidents>Should Other 'Real Housewives' Stars Been Fired for Their Incidents?</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>When it comes to other sexual misconducts, the incident between <a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</strong></a> star <a href=#><strong>Brandi Glanville</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</strong></a> star <a href=#><strong>Caroline Manzo</strong></a> caused a lawsuit to be filed and the future of <a href=#><strong>Real Housewives Ultimate Girls' Trip</strong></a> to potentially never see the light of day. While no one was fired from the show, <a href=#>it did place a dark cloud over production.</a> And this wasn't the first time Brandi Glanville had been told to stop doing something. <strong>She slapped <a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump</a> </strong>on a dinner boat in Amsterdam on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical brawls have been a part of the world of The Real Housewives.</a> At the end of the day in the real world, many of these incidents may fall into the guise of assault. Without it leading to that, many individuals who have had physical altercations may have simply received a slap on the wrist. <a href=#>The most recent example was between The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a>'s <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aydin</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Danielle Cabral</strong></a>. <strong>It was reported that both women were temporarily suspended for the fight</strong>, which the program just aired, but returned to film thereafter. There have been heated exchanges that have resulted in shattered glass flying across the table. <a href=#><strong>Romana Singer</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a> and Jennifer Aydin were not scolded for these television moments.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kenya-moore-on-the-real-housewives-of-atlanta.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title=" 'RHOA' Star Kenya Moore Has Tax Troubles Amid Suspension">'RHOA' Star Kenya Moore Has Tax Troubles Amid Suspension</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Moore's troubles are piling up faster than a 'Real Housewives' argument.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back to The Real Housewives of New Jersey, brothers-in-law <a href=#><strong>Joe Gorga</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Joe Giudice</strong></a> famously got into a horrendous fight at <strong>Joey Gorga</strong>'s Christening AND at the attempted peace retreat when <a href=#><strong>Teresa Giudice</strong></a> alleged that her brother called her "scum." <strong>Fists flew between the men at <a href=#>Nene Leakes</a>' pajama party</strong>. <a href=#><strong>Danielle Staub</strong></a> has been involved in two separate weave pulls on The Real Housewives of New Jersey. <strong>Adriana de Moura</strong> punched <strong>Joanna Krupa</strong> on <a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Miami</strong></a>. There was the winery brawl on <a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Potomic</strong></a> between <a href=#><strong>Candiace Dillard</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Monique Samuels</strong></a>. The list is endless. But what has been proven is the consequences for these awful real-life situations have been near nothing.<strong></strong></p><p>Over the years, many cast members throughout the various flagships have had a brush with the law. While everyone deserves a second chance, do arrests signal the end? History has shown that no, it's not the end.<strong> Teresa Giudice famously went to prison</strong> and turned that into a brief spin-off series. <a href=#><strong>Jen Shah</strong></a> is currently in jail, but the door has never been officially shut so she can't return to <a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</strong></a> following her sentence.

Perhaps contracts need to be created where severe incidents result in immediate termination. Bravo may say they don't condone violence, but with Kenya's dismissal, <strong>they seem to only worry about emotional violence over physical violence.</strong> What Kenya Moore allegedly did is wrong. It was shameful. She deserved the consequences she received. But is she being made an example of? It's quite difficult to decide as the standard has changed. Now the question remains, <strong>how will Bravo handle Kenya's appearance during Season 16?</strong></p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta is available to stream on Peacock.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stream on Peacock</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kuKa62Jpkpqefp7JuvseomGaemaeypXnBq5ivp18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kio-cyr.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kio Cyr Bio, Age, Height, Single, Nationality, Net Worth, Facts">&larr;
