So why are 31-year-old Machine Gun Kelly and 24-year-old Sydney Sweeney being linked to each other — and what is their relationship like today?</p><h2 id=does-sydney-sweeney-know-machine-gun-kelly>Does Sydney Sweeney Know Machine Gun Kelly?</h2><p>Machine Gun Kelly and Sydney Sweeney met in 2018 on the set of the coming-of-age comedy movie Big Time Adolescence, which also stars <a href=#>the musician's close friend Pete Davidson</a>.

You know, when, when he loses Scarlet, he’s faced with temptation success and, you know, he’s young, he has the opportunity to get over this person, but he never does. And in that it drives him crazy. That is, I just wanted to highlight themes that aren’t made in movies. I’m sick of seeing people like treat love like it’s trivial, right. That we can just move past it. Like, because if it’s real love, you can’t move past it and you shouldn’t move past it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-also-worked-with-megan-fox>Sydney Sweeney Also Worked With Megan Fox</h2><p>Apart from working with Machine Gun Kelly on two separate projects, Sydney Sweeney is also no stranger to the musician's finacé.

But I trust Colson more with a tattoo, and I think that he would do something that I’d want, so I’d probably do [my dog] Tank’s paw print or something.
