A source only confirmed to People that the actress had given birth in New York.</p><p class=dh>The "Gossip Girl" star is known not to announce when she's pregnant but lets everyone find out that she's expecting during her appearances on the red carpet. She revealed during the Cannes Film Festival in May 2016 that she was pregnant with Inez when she showed her growing baby bump.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5885395fc681c0e43e264d4ae02eea12.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Blake Lively at the 69th annual Cannes Film Festival at the Palais des Festivals on May 14, 2016, in Cannes, France.

Inez's mother set the record straight on her daughter's name when she was less than a year old.</p><p class=dh>It was only during an interview with People in September 2017 that the "All I See Is You" actress officially confirmed the spelling of the name.

She told people that her second child was not sleeping through the night "because she was a baby."</p><p class=dh>Blake detailed how that changed over time as Inez got old. She said Inez could finally sleep through the night; however, her older sister James struggled to sleep. The actress said her oldest "decided that she doesn't sleep through the night anymore."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a8b075365b030b50808409ef030f0c84.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Blake Lively and daughter attend the ceremony that honored Ryan Reynolds with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on December 15, 2016, in Hollywood, California. I Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Inez Is into Villains</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Inez's father, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/ryan-reynolds-daughter-super-into-villains/>Ryan Reynolds</a>, revealed in 2019 that she likes movie villain characters. In May 2019, during an appearance on "Live with Kelly and Ryan," the "Pok√©mon: Detective Pikachu" actor talked about his daughters and revealed that Inez is a fan of villains. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLcM4PoEZhw">said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"She's super into villains. We watch Beauty and the Beast, and her favorite character is Gaston."</p><p class=dh>The doting dad also mentioned how the 5-year-old's doctor caught on to her pull to the "dark side." When their pediatrician met Inez, she said the little one was "shady." Reynolds agreed and recounted one day at the airport on their way home when a funny situation unfolded. Inez, only two years old at the time, got selected for a secondary security pat down, and she took it in stride as Ryan <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLcM4PoEZhw">joked</a>, "She just takes it like a hard-earned felon."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Inez Has a Sense of Style</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In mid-2021, Inez's mother shared a photo of her dressed in a pink and white outfit. She revealed in the Instagram post that her daughter, who was four at the time, insisted on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/blake-lively-models-hilarious-outfit-daughter-inez-picked-out-for-mom-photo/>picking the outfit</a> for her while she was trying to get the little one dressed.</p><p class=dh>Inez picked out a bright pink top and white floral printed skirt for her mother. Blake captioned the post by saying she was trying to get her 4-year-old dressed at 5 a.m., but she insisted on dressing her instead. It seems <a class="me a" href=#>Blake Lively</a>'s daughter has a sense of style, and the "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" actress is enjoying all the fun and memorable moments with her little one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbmhlaHqqusSzZKudqaO8rbDSZqOio5Woeq671aKcZq6Zobmitc2sZG5llpbAb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rodrigo-reyes-bio-age-net-worth-height-southern-charm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Rodrigo Reyes!
