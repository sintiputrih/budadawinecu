In order to help lower testosterone and increase estrogen, she addicted to junk food and started eating smaller portions.&nbsp;Rumor has it that the changes have already started to go into effect.</span></p><h2><span>Caitlyn Jenner body measurements</span></h2><p><span>Besides Caitlyn Jenner’s height and weight, here is a summary of her body measurements.</span></p><p><span>Height: 6 feet 2 inches</span></p><p><span>Weight: 88 kilograms</span></p><p><span>Dress size: 10</span></p><p><span>Bra Size: 34D</span></p><p><span>Chest size: 38 inches</span></p><p><span>Waist size: 27 inches</span></p><p><span>Hip size: 38 inches</span></p><p><span>Size: 13 US, 46 EU, 12.5 UK</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGibkZ7BrcXNZqGepp6av260xKKeoaxdrLKqs8etZJqmlGKvsLDYZqSemaOqv6a5xKerrGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./charlize-theron-addresses-gabriel-aubry-dating-rumors-watch-w493692.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlize Theron Addresses Gabriel Aubry Dating Rumors: Watch!">&larr;
