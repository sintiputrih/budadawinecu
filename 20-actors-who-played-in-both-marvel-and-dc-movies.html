Many big-time actors were chosen to star in these movies, sometimes the same actors for different roles. Sometimes they would go from villain to superhero, or vice versa, and sometimes they would go from a supporting role to a lead. There were no boundaries for them, they just went where the paychecks were.</p><p>Here are 20 actors who played roles in both DC and Marvel films.</p><h2 id=tommy-lee-jones-colonel-chester-phillips-in-captain-america-the-first-avenger-amp-two-face-in-batman-forever><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Tommy Lee Jones (Colonel Chester&nbsp;Phillips In Captain America: The First Avenger&nbsp;& Two-Face In Batman Forever)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Untitled-design-1-2.png><p>Tommy Lee Jones is an actor who does better at roles where he gets to yell and boss people around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to screencrush.com, Tommy played one of Batman’s arch nemesis, Two-Face in Batman Forever.
