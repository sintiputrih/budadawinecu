However, the celebrities on today’s list are doing everything but playing it safe as they tend to go for glittery eyeshadows, holographic lips, patterned eyeliner, and yes — even plenty of face jewels. Honestly, these celebs have it all figured out because at the end of the day makeup should be fun — so why not think out of the box?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs Who Have Perfected The Art Of The No-Makeup Selfie" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Have Perfected The Art Of The No-Makeup Selfie</a></span></p><p>From musicians such as Dua Lipa and Halsey, over makeup brand owners like Rihanna and Kylie Jenner, to a surprise Hollywood star — keep on scrolling to find out just which celebrities absolutely love playing around with their makeup.</p><h2 id=dua-lipa><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Dua Lipa</span></h2><p>Kicking the list off is British musician Dua Lipa who rose to fame because of her fun pop songs but also because of her bold and funky fashion and makeup choices. In the photos above, the star can be seen rocking some very daring makeup looks, but as fans already know — Dua Lipa is all about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">having fun with makeup</a>!</p><h2 id=halsey><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Halsey</span></h2><p>Next on the list is musician Halsey who has undoubtedly changed her style quite a lot since her breakthrough. Halsey is definitely not afraid of switching things up and she certainly doesn’t stick to the same safe makeup choices. In the photos above, the musician can be seen rocking some colorful glittery eyeshadow as well as very graphic white eyeliner! Halsey always rocks <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">incredibly quirky makeup looks</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rihanna><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rihanna</span></h2><p>A star who has certainly played around with makeup for a long time is musician Rihanna. The Barbadian star is the absolute <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">queen of rocking bold lip colors</a> and there certainly isn't a color out there that RiRi hasn’t worn on her lips yet.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Naomi Campbell & 9 Other Celebs Who Do Their Own Makeup" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Naomi Campbell & 9 Other Celebs Who Do Their Own Makeup</a></span></p><p>In the pics above, the star can be also seen playing around with a lot of pink blush, and she totally pulls the dramatic look off!</p><h2 id=kesha><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kesha</span></h2><p>Another musician who certainly loves expressing herself through her makeup is Kesha. Now, while the diva looks incredible without any makeup when all her beautiful freckles are visible — there is no doubt the fans love seeing all the funky makeup looks that Kesha always rocks! Seriously, how cool is that eye look made out of face jewels?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=doja-cat><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Doja Cat</span></h2><p>A somewhat new celebrity on the funky makeup scene is rapper Doja Cat. The star — who rose to fame in the past couple of years — is definitely not afraid of rocking some unusual locks, whether it’s different eyeshadows on each eye or completely bedazzled eyebrows. Doja Cat is definitely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a fashion icon</a> and major makeup inspiration!</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kylie Jenner</span></h2><p>A star that obviously deserves a spot on today’s list is reality television star and makeup mogul Kylie Jenner. Now everyone probably already knows that Kylie started plenty of popular makeup trends but what many may not be aware of is that the diva actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">isn’t afraid of experimenting with her look</a>. Granted, some celebs on today’s list go are much braver when it comes to their look — but at the end of the day, Kylie also loves playing around with colors, as seen in the photos above!</p><h2 id=katy-perry><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Katy Perry</span></h2><p>Another musician that found her way onto today’s list is Katy Perry. Ever since her breakthrough, Katy has been known for her love for fun outfits and colorful makeup looks — and nothing has really changed over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Best Makeup Tips From Celebrities" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Best Makeup Tips From Celebrities</a></span></p><p>In the photos above, Katy can be seen rocking some candy cane inspired eyeliner as well as fun jewels around her eyes!</p><h2 id=bella-thorne><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Bella Thorne</span></h2><p>Next on the list is former Disney Channel star Bella Thorne who is yet another celebrity that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">isn't afraid of wild makeup looks</a>. Whether she goes crazy with glitter on her for a music festival face or is rocking some dark holographic lips for the red carpet — Bella Thorne is certainly not scared of wearing makeup that most people wouldn’t even dare to put on!</p><h2 id=lady-gaga><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Lady Gaga</span></h2><p>A list like this would certainly not be complete without the iconic Lady Gaga who rose to fame not only because of her incredible music — but also because of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very eccentric outfits</a> and super-unique make-up looks that definitely aren't everyone's cup of tea. Lady Gaga is certainly a star who isn't afraid of experimenting and her makeup has honestly always been on another level!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-porter><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Billy Porter</span></h2><p>Wrapping the list up is none other than Hollywood star Billy Porter who loves playing around with his look. One thing that is evident is is that whenever Billy decides to rock makeup, he always make sure that perfectly matches his outfit — as seen in the photos above.
