She goes to numerous events with her husband and supports him with all her heart. They even go to spend vacations along with their son and celebrate special occasions together.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Erdenetuya's&nbsp;sound relationship with her husband is also evident on social sites.&nbsp;On the occasion of Steven's 66th birthday in April 2018, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a> a heartfelt message. She stated that she could not be more proud of him today for having lived such a wonderful life where he has achieved and accomplished so much in just one lifetime.</p><p>So, with good fortune and a loving husband, the former dancer is replenishing her life along with her ascending age.</p><h2>Her Husband Steven Was Married Thrice Previously</h2><p>Before marrying Erdenetuya, Steven was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a> thrice, making Erdenetuya his fourth wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The actor first got married in 1974 to Miyako Fujitani, a Japanese Aikido instructor. They had met the same year at the Los Angeles International Airport in July. Together, they gave birth to three children,&nbsp;but sadly, they lost the third child. Their marriage ended in 1986.</p><p>“Once he was gone, he was gone ... On top of running the dojo, I had to raise my children. I don't know how we got by. Sometimes we could only afford cheap brown rice for dinner,” Miyako said during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Dojo outlet in 2000.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After that, Steven married his second wife, Adrienne La Russa, actress known for shop-opera Days of our Lives, in 1984. But their marriage lasted for a couple of years only, as they divorced in 1986. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The following year, he married for the third time — he tied knots with actress Kelly LeBrock in 1987.

During the height of Hollywood's #MeToo movement, Erdenetuya's husband was also one of the celebrities accused of sexual misconduct. His history with sexual misconduct, however, goes way back before the marriage with&nbsp;her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Around their marriage, Erdenetuya 's husband was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">involved</a> in a&nbsp;$1 million sexual harassment lawsuit against his former assistant Kayden Nguyen.

Way before Stephen met his now-wife, actresses Jenny McCarthy and Cheryl Shuman had accused him of harassment and assault.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Steven had already been enmeshed in three&nbsp;lawsuits and numerous accusations, and even more cases came out during the #MeToo movement. During a recent interview with the BBC, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">walked</a> out on the interviewer when asked about his rape allegations&nbsp;even before completing her question.</p><p>Despite the overwhelming number of accusations, the actor&nbsp;has continued to deny all of his accusations. Erdenetuya, on the other hand, has remained silent, whether because of her loyalty to the husband or because she has no idea about all this is hard to tell.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><h2>Erdenetuya Enjoys Hefty Net worth with Actor Husband</h2><p>Whatever goes on with her husband on the outside, Elle's inside married life is garnished with luxury because of Steven's hefty net worth.&nbsp;</p><p>He is one of the&nbsp;most famous actors of Hollywood, who has had his hands in directing, writing, and producing the projects of the entertainment realm. He is also a&nbsp;martial artist who has skills in&nbsp;various&nbsp;arts, including&nbsp;Karate, Judo, Kendo,&nbsp;and Aikido.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>With over three decades of dedication in the industry, the Under Siege actor has more than 50 acting credits on his&nbsp;list, which has helped him&nbsp;acclaim a total <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $16 million.</p><h2>Her Bio: Top Dancer of Her Country</h2><p>Erdenetuya was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> as&nbsp;Erdenetuya Batsukh in Mongolia and is famously known as Elle. The information on her parents, siblings, and family remains confined to date. Moreover, her age and birthday to are unknown to the media.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>But it came to the limelight that she attended dancing classes at the Children's Palace in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, from a very young age.</p><p>After the completion of her high school and training, Elle went&nbsp;onto be a professional dancer. Later, she competed in numerous dancing competitions and even won many titles.&nbsp;With her dancing abilities and skills, she became one of her country's top dancers and topped in&nbsp;ballroom dance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnlaexprrErayymV2osqKzwKVkmp%2BVYrW2v8GapZ1lk522rbDRnqVmpp%2BseqetzKKjsmWSnrxvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./meredith-morris-age-how-old-is-johnny-gaudreau-wife-wiki-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meredith Morris Age: How Old Is Johnny Gaudreau Wife?
