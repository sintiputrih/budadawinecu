Justin Kiriakis (Wally too) also has been MIA on Days; they replaced him as Tate’s lawyer. Usually, Wally will be missing on GH if he’s busy on Days & vice versa.

What a beauty!</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Thank you. That was Chandler, who is named after Adam Chandler from All My Children. He was the last of the 3 C’s (Chloe, Caleb, his siblings). I decided to honor him. He died November 8th at 17 years old. He will probably be my last cat because I’m 70 now. It wouldn’t be fair to get another kitten. My home is so quiet without him.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pensive.png title=:pensive: alt=:pensive: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>9 Likes</span></p><p>What a sweetie he was. My cat Serena, 17 years old, passed October 22nd 2022, I had to have her put to sleep and send her to Heaven because of her diabetes. I cried for 3 weeks and a friend of mine I owe her so much because she listened to me crying on the phone practically every day. I do have another cat though she’s 5 years old but I think she will be my last Kitty as well because I’m 71. Even though my daughter said if anything happens to me she would take care of Luna, that’s her name, I still have decided it will be my last kitty. The only thing I might do, maybe you might consider this too, is adopting a senior cat about 13 or 14 years old and making its last year’s happy, I was just reading about it, that idea appeals to me. I have my five year old Luna running around with the Zoomies as I am posting this!</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>Yes! I just mentioned that to her. Adopting an older cat from a shelter and making its last few years happy. Of course we have to suffer their losses but they’re not supposed to outlive us. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sparkling_heart.png title=:sparkling_heart: alt=:sparkling_heart: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Even a 5-8 year old cat -</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvLqKakZaedvG60wKxkoKeemnqutdKsoKefX21%2FdYWYbw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michael-chiarello-net-worth-income-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Chiarello Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
