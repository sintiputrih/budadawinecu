The dramedy follows the chaotic and troubled Gallagher family as they try to make ends meet on the South Side of Chicago. The patriarch of the family, Frank, is an alcoholic who spends most of his time drinking at the local pub. His kids, meanwhile, are left to fend for themselves and navigate life without the guidance of a parent who truly cares for them. Watching them use their street smarts to make ends meet is nothing if not entertaining, and at the end of the day, many of their struggles are ones we can all relate to.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Shameless aired from 2011 to 2021 and is now officially over, but we’ll never stop loving it. Since we miss each and every member of the Gallagher clan, we thought we’d take a look at what they’re all up to today.</p><h3 id=emmy-rossum data-injectable=false>Emmy Rossum</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Emmy Rossum (@emmy)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Emmy Rossum didn’t stay with Shameless until it finished in 2021. She parted ways with the show after season nine, making a shocking announcement about her decision to leave the series in Aug. 2018. As she wrote on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>, “I know you will continue on without me, for now. There is much more Gallagher story to be told. I will always be waiting for my family. Try not to think of me as gone, just think of me as moving down the block.”</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>These days, Rossum has gotten busy in the world of directing, making major moves behind the scenes. She directed episodes of Animal Kingdom and Modern Love and also starred in a biopic called Angelyne about the billboard model everyone was once so curious about. In 2017, she tied the knot with screenwriter Sam Esmail, and in 2021 they welcomed their daughter into the world.</p><h3 id=william-h-macy data-injectable=false>William H.

Since 1997, he’s been married to Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman. They share two daughters named Georgia and Sophia and in 2019, they unfortunately made headlines for being involved in the college admissions scandal heard ‘round the world. While Huffman had to serve time for her involvement in the scandal, Macy had no charges filed against him.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Macy has a recurring role in the highly-anticipated series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dropout</a>, which chronicles the case of Elizabeth Holmes, also known as the founder of Theranos ⏤ the company defrauded investors and patients and was formally dissolved in 2018.

His character was the second-oldest child in the family, and along with being one of the main stars of the show, he has also starred in Homecoming, Law & Order, and The Bear. He married actress Addison Timlin in 2019. Together they have two daughters named Ezer and Wild. Before Shameless ended, White had nothing but positive things to say about the show. As he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Film Inquiry</a>, “In the case of Shameless, it’s never ending. Lip’s always growing, as I’m growing. His decision making is always changing. He becomes a little better of a person, then a little bit worse. It’s more like life, because it’s been so, so long.”</p><h3 id=cameron-monaghan data-injectable=false>Cameron Monaghan</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.instagram.com/p/CPMQWiVr9TE/</figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Cameron Monaghan played Ian Gallagher on Shameless. Along with being a pivotal character, Monaghan has also starred in shows such as Mercy Street, Gotham, and NCIS. Some of his movies include Mall, The Giver, Vampire Academy, and The Year of Spectacular Men. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nerds of Color</a>, Monaghan opened up about the end of this incredible show:</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>“Things are difficult in general, but I feel like, especially with a show like Shameless, which is a show about a slice of life and sort of how existence doesn’t really fall into a perfect narrative; it tends to be messy and kind of just continue in spite of itself, and it’s a stream of those little victories and these constant mistakes. So you can’t really cap off of a pure ending to a story like that,” the actor said.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>It’s true that watching Shameless come to an end was difficult. It’s certainly relatable to anyone who has grown up in a low-income neighborhood or dealt with family dynamics that are less than perfect.</p><h3 id=emma-kenney data-injectable=false>Emma Kenney</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Emma🌹Kenney (@emmakenney)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Emma Kenney played the role of Debbie Gallagher, the younger Gallagher daughter in the family. From 2018 to 2021, she also starred in the Roseanne reboot The Conners. These days, Kenney has over 2 million followers on Instagram and loves to post gorgeous pictures from photoshoots and vacations. From an outsider’s perspective, it looks like she’s living the best life ever.</p><p data-characters=754 data-current-count=1137 data-injectable=true>From Kenny’s perspective, she didn’t have the greatest experience working with Rossum on Shameless for the first nine seasons. According to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> E-News</a>, she described the on-set relationship saying, “I was obviously a lot younger. There were times when she would try to be a good influence and then there were times where she would be blatantly giving me bad… not the best advice.” Kenney also spoke about a sense of competition she felt on set with Rossum, saying, “I don’t know if it was other people on set creating that or if it was her creating that, but I know I wasn’t creating it.” It doesn’t seem like the two ladies of Shameless are on the best of terms these days, even though they spent so many years playing sisters on camera.</p><h3 id=ethan-cutkosky data-injectable=false>Ethan Cutkosky</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.instagram.com/p/CZP1wYGPo9v/</figure><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Ethan Cutkosky played the role of Carl Gallagher on Shameless.
