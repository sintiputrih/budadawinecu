The main characters had popular catchphrases, it was a heartwarming family-oriented show, and even though it was light-hearted and funny, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many episodes handled difficult topics</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Jodie Sweetin, who played loveable Stephanie Tanner, is all grown up and the mom of two daughters. Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">daughter Zoie is a teenager now</a>&nbsp;and her younger child, Beatrix, is 10 years old.</p><p>Jodie Sweetin has been very open about the hard times she has faced. Did she like starring on&nbsp;Full House? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=being-a-child-star>Being A Child Star</h2><p>Fans of&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;always want to hear about what life was like on the set of the popular '90s family sitcom.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jodie Sweetin shared that it was tough to say goodbye to the show</a>&nbsp;as she wasn't sure if she and the cast would stay in touch and that was really sad.</p><p>In her memoir&nbsp;unSweetined, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jodie Sweetin&nbsp;described her&nbsp;experience&nbsp;on the set</a>&nbsp;and said that it was tough. She explained what it was like being a child star: she wrote, “On set, I just wanted to be a kid. But Full House was a job and I was expected to behave like a miniature adult.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Collider, Sweetin has also talked about the tough times that she had, as she began drinking alcohol when she was 14 years old and&nbsp;started abusing meth.</p><p>E! News&nbsp;reported that Sweetin used meth daily and she explained,&nbsp;"Everything revolved around my addiction.&nbsp;On a typical day, I'd wake up and feel terrible because I hadn't done any. You're either trying to get it, doing it or worrying about when you're going to get it next. You don't even realize that it's taken over so quickly."</p><p>It sounds like it was really tough for Sweetin when&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;went off the air after 8 seasons. According to&nbsp;Ranker.com, she was 13, and she shared that this led to her abusing alcohol. She said,&nbsp;"There is a certain sense of loss when a series ends. It is kind of hard to figure out who you are when you've lost your job at age 13, when that was basically how you identified yourself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ranker.com&nbsp;says that when Sweetin was 20 years old, she wasn't sure that she would return to Hollywood and act. She said,&nbsp;"I don't have any desire to ever act again full time. I don't mind doing occasional guest appearances on shows, but I have other things I'd like to do in my life now."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What John Stamos Has Been Up To Since His Time On “Full House”</a></span></p><h2 id=some-full-house-memories>Some 'Full House' Memories</h2><p>While Jodie Sweetin has had a tough time&nbsp;and she has been very open and candid about her drug and alcohol abuse, she can also look back on&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;fondly, as it sounds like she loved portraying Stephanie and she has many favorite episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with&nbsp;Today.com, Sweetin said that she remembers when Stephanie was nervous after there was an earthquake in San Francisco.

She talked about how&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;had a&nbsp; "very special episode" each time and this one stood out.</p><p>Sweetin also mentioned the episode when Stephanie was driving Joey's car and she drove right into the Tanner family kitchen. She laughed that instead of being angry, the family members talked to Stephanie and it was "a learning moment about family."</p><p>Jodie Sweetin shared in an interview with&nbsp;People&nbsp;that she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wants people to relate to her struggles</a>. She said, “For a long time it was just uncomfortable and I wanted to pretend that everything was okay. But you just really have to embrace it and go, ‘You know what, whatever it is that we’ve been through or who we are, life happens to everyone regardless of if you’re famous or not.’ If people get to hear a little bit more of my story and they can relate because I happen to be famous, then I think it’s actually a really amazing opportunity.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="How Much Did Candace Cameron Bure Earn From 'Full House'?" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Did Candace Cameron Bure Earn From 'Full House'?</a></span></p><p>When the opportunity to do a reboot of&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;came around, Jodie Sweetin took it, and she reprised her famous role of Stephanie Tanner in all five seasons of&nbsp;Fuller House.</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;People, Sweetin said that she goes to colleges and talks about being a child star and then moving on from her addiction, and she wants people to know that it's possible to move forward and have a better life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's Why Bob Saget Almost Quit 'Full House'" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Bob Saget Almost Quit 'Full House'</a></span></p><p>Fans are glad to learn that after many years of struggling, Jodie Sweetin is doing really well today.
