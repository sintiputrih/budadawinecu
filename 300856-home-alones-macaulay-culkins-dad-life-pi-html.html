The famous child star is one of seven siblings who grew up under an absent father. The kids grew up close, and some of Macaulay's siblings even followed him into acting.</p><p class=dh>Macaulay's older sister Dakota, or Cody, as the siblings referred to her, was one of the child star's biggest supporters, and he loved her dearly. Sadly, she passed away in 2008, which left the young Macaulay distraught. His sister passed away after she was hit by a car on her way to a local store.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/cccd65ddf83bef459b8ab0f5bec2bf9a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Macaulay Culkin at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Macaulay recalled the night it happened. He had spoken to the 30-year-old Dakota a few hours before she took off to buy some things for her and her roommate. Right before she left her apartment, she called her brother to tell him they had watched "Party Monster" and enjoyed it. Her last words to him were words of encouragement as he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a30680749/macaulay-culkin-interview-life-now-after-home-alone-2020/>recalled</a>:</p><p class=dh>"She said, 'We just watched "Party Monster," and we wanted to compliment you.' She said, 'I want you to stay focused and enthused.' I was like, 'Thanks. You too. Go to sleep.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/07f6d40c347fe468acde870fddf53411.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Macaulay Culkin, Kieran Culkin, United Kingdom, circa 1991 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Right after the phone call, Dakota stepped out briefly, and the following day, Macaulay woke up to the news of his sister's death. Eleven years later, as he told the story, he still celebrated her life and remembered how she encouraged him. However, a little while after her death, Macaulay gave up the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1093930/Tragedy-cursed-Macaulay-Culkin-sister-killed-struck-car-LA.html>spotlight</a>.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Privately Becoming Dad His His 40S Gave Him Joy</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>After a few years of turmoil and finding himself, Macaulay finally felt ready to get back into the public eye. However, he did so tentatively. The actor even starred in another film called "Changeland." This turned out to be one of the best decisions he could have made, since he met the actress Brenda Song on set.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Parenting came naturally to both Brenda and Macaulay.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f8f976bc00c19147cb0fa50e4e2c4bf1.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Macaulay Culkin on May 11, 2005 in Santa Maria, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/AmoMamaNostalgia/posts/pfbid02mTDWErEFTpScLcEBT7qwkhZSKJVNe3HPepngXCpKdbWVkxyArEqRVccVrukgfHyul>Macaulay</a> and Brenda grew close during the film's shooting, and when they returned from shooting the movie in Thailand, they moved in together. Then, in 2021, a new addition to Macaulay and Brenda"s family arrived. Their first baby was born in Los Angeles on Monday, April 5.</p><p class=dh>They named the new <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a36094413/macaulay-culkin-brenda-song-son-dakota/>baby boy</a> Dakota Song after Macaulay's sister and the mother of his child. For his first birthday, Macaulay and Brenda had his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CcGh5XUvXl-/>party</a> at Sesame Place in San Diego, and the proud father shared some <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B0wC0mCgNqH/>snaps</a> of him and little Dakota at home. Overall, though, the parents keep their lives extremely private.</p><p class=dh>Every now and again, Macaulay does give his fans a subtle update about how their lives are going. Most recently, he shared an image of a purple plastic dish with a smiley face made out of cereal and half a banana. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn93OwAJMaf/>captioned</a> it simply, "Making breakfast."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Second Baby and Wedding?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>The two new parents spend most of their time at home, caring for their little one. In an Instagram post, Brenda showed fans one of the few times the couple went out to do something fun together. In the image, they could be seen next to a football field with the LA Rams mascot.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Finally, after years of hiding from the press and avoiding fame, Macaulay has found a place where he feels comfortable.</strong></h3><p class=dh>However, parenting came naturally to both Brenda and Macaulay. Although it certainly has its challenges, the couple has made their son their priority, basing their career decisions around baby Dakota and focusing on him above everything else. A source <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/brenda-song-macaulay-culkin-definitely-want-more-kids-soon/>opened up</a> about their life after having Dakota:</p><p class=dh>"Brenda couldn't be happier. Becoming a mom has changed her. She's always putting her son first, especially when it comes to making career decisions. She is really focused on being a mom and giving him her full attention. She has a good support system around her, but she and Macaulay are really hands-on parents."</p><p class=dh>According to the source, Brenda and Macaulay are considering having another baby, and a wedding is in the works. They've been devoting most of their time to raising Dakota, but they love being parents, and the marriage should become a reality in the next year or so. The source <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/brenda-song-macaulay-culkin-definitely-want-more-kids-soon/>explained</a>:</p><p class=dh>"They're focusing on raising Dakota for now but definitely want to plan a wedding and get married in the next year or two. They're committed to each other and are fully in it for the long haul. They're very in love with each other and have been from the beginning."</p><p class=dh>Finally, after years of hiding from the press and avoiding fame, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/AmoMamaNostalgia/posts/pfbid0S5zTZdgNcVNimxxLXpK76bMX9Drb3gA2wD58AY4pAyDHuJQApv74tB3JjZFZrGb8l>Macaulay</a> has found a place where he feels comfortable. After the blow of losing his beloved sister, Macaulay has recovered nicely, and with the birth of his son, he has a part of Dakota with him again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmxnaXBla3qpu8yeZJqkn6OytHnMmpqarZyWxm6v1KWioqajYrGisIyloJ%2BdXaW2b7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ken-palmer-kids-brooke-megan-and-christen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Get To Know Ken Palmer Kids: Brooke, Megan And Christen!">&larr;
