Here’s the thing: You can’t win that way. But I didn’t know that.</li><li>I’m very concerned about the tone of politics in recent years. We’ve seen a decline in civility and bipartisanship, and a rapid increase in hostility between those who have differing opinions. I think this has led to the alienation of the public in governance, which jeopardizes democratic participation.</li><li>My parents are very conservative. They taught me the value of hard work – don’t depend on other people, do it yourself.</li><li>I have great respect for the LDS church – their commitment to family and taking care of each other is exemplary. I just don’t believe the tenets of the faith that they believe.</li><li>On most holidays, you’ll find me in Mexico. Actually, on most holidays you won’t find me.

One was kind of this individual work ethic that my father and my stepfather and my mother all taught me, which was never depend on anyone else to do things for you, and work really hard on your own. At the same time, I benefited from the help of church and family and government my whole life.</li><li>A huge dollar bill is the most accurate way to teach children the real motto of the United States: In the Almighty Dollar We Trust… Until the average American realizes that capitalism damages her livelihood while augmenting the livelihoods of the wealthy, the Almighty Dollar will continue to rule. It certainly is not ruling in our favor.</li><li>I was just born involved in politics.
