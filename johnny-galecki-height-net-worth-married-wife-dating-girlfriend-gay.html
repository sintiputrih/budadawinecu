Ari Graynor is the next woman who was his girlfriend and then Kelsey Harper before coming to Kaley Cuoco.&nbsp;After Galecki and Cuoco separated in real life, he continued to date other women, although as of now, he still has no wife and has never been married.</span></p><p>One thing people keep asking is whether Johnny Galecki is gay or not.&nbsp;This is understandable because Jim Parsons (Sheldon Cooper in&nbsp;<span>The Big Bang Theory</span><span>&nbsp;is gay).&nbsp;But then, Johnny is not gay.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>In case you’re wondering how much he’s worth, especially since he hasn’t appeared in as many movies as many other actors, it will interest you to know that the man is worth a lot.&nbsp;More recently, it was reported that he was the highest paid actor in the world, but that is actually untrue.&nbsp;It was actually in 2014 that he emerged as one of Forbes magazine’s highest-paid actors.</span></p><p><span>In 2017, he became one of the highest paid actors in television, according to the Forbes list.&nbsp;He was only the second&nbsp;</span><span>The Big Bang Theory</span><span>&nbsp;actor, Jim Parsons who also makes a million dollars per episode of the Sit-Com.</span></p><p><strong><span>See Also: Kaley Cuoco Sister, Husband, Divorce, Dating, Boyfriend, Father</span></strong></p><p><span>The truth is, following the million dollars per episode he gets paid for appearing on&nbsp;</span><span>The Big Bang Theory</span><span>&nbsp;as well as other things he’s been a part of, Johnny Galecki has a net worth of $45 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height Johnny Galecki</span></strong></h2><p><span>A handsome man who can be extra classy whenever he wants, here’s everything you need to know about Galecki’s height and general body measurements:</span></p><p><strong><span>Height</span></strong><span>&nbsp;: 5′ 5″ (1.65m)</span></p><p><strong><span>Weight:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;66 kg (145 lbs)</span></p><p><strong><span>Net Worth</span></strong></p><ul><li><strong><span>Chest</span></strong><span>&nbsp;– 40 inches or 102 cm</span></li><li><strong><span>Arms / biceps</span></strong><span>&nbsp;– 13.5 inches or 34 cm</span></li><li><strong><span>Height</span></strong><span>&nbsp;– 35 inches or 89 cm</span></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiin527r8WMoJilnZOgtm60xKKeoaxdo7K1edaoqa2gXaKus77Inptmr5mbsm6wwK2gp59dnLazuMWroJ6mlGK0osWO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nba-terrance-mann-height-how-tall-is-he-luka-doncic-comments-on-his-physical-structure.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NBA: Terrance Mann Height -How Tall Is He?
