At the end of each episode, one designer is eliminated, leaving only one to walk away with a cash prize of $200,000 and a golden opportunity to launch their collection on Rent The Runway.</p><p>Usama Ishtay first announced his participation in the show via an Instagram post on January 27, 2023. Sharing the teaser for the show, Usama wrote, “Are you ready??? OMG! Excited to announce I’ll be competing on Next in Fashion Season 2.

Raised in Venezuela with an Arabic background, Usama was greatly influenced by the women in his family who worked in fashion design. Owning a clothing store in Venezuela was Usama’s foray into the fashion industry. As a part of the shop’s requirement, Usama often traveled to Los Angeles to buy and ship merchandise to his own country.</p><p>In 2015, Usama moved to Los Angeles to study fashion design. Then, he went on to launch his own company, Usama Ishtay. Between November 2017 and July 2020, Usama worked for the brand Melissa Mercedes as a creative director and between January 2015 and June 2016 at Martin Zepeda Designs.</p><p>Most of his works on <a href=#>usamaishtay.com</a> are “inspired by Arabic and Latino culture” with the latter giving his design “a slight beauty queen whiff with a rock and roll and mysticism.”</p><p>Usama’s first big break was when he designed a blue laced-up dress for the rapper Eve. The gown was later donated to Autism Speaks, a cause close to Usama’s heart. The reality TV star said that the experience “opened numerous opportunities” for him within the fashion world. Later, Usama got the dress artists like Tyra Banks, Carrie Underwood, Thalia, Jeannie Mai, Paulina Rubio, Lauren London, Lauren Jauregui, and Nikita Dragun.</p><p>In 2022, the petroleum engineer and geologist turned designer dressed rapper Saweetie for cosmetics firm M.A.C.’s latest campaign. In March 2023, Usama has a launch for his new collection in a parade that he anticipates will have a modern, bright, and sensual touch.</p><p>As the article by encantadacon.com.ve outlined “the mixture of empowerment and sensuality that Usama’s creations transmit” is the reason why he is so special. Usually, the women who wear Usama’s designs are “confident women, determined and willing to take on the world.” Furthermore, Usama also revealed the secret of his success to encantadacon.com.ve. He said, “You have to always stay relevant by doing exceptional work, and creating your own trends.”</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Usama Ishtay?</strong></h3><p>Born in 1988, Usama Ishtay was 34 years old in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Usama Ishtay Family</strong></h3><p>Talking about Usama Ishtay’s family, the Netflix star had a great sense of fashion as a child.
