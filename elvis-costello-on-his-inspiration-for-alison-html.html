Long one of music’s wittiest, smartest, and most perceptive lyricists, Costello has done his legacy proud with his new book, which, thankfully, goes far beyond his angry-young-man days, most movingly in its frequent reminiscences about the relationship between the singer and his musician father. In the excerpt below, Costello recounts a pivotal period early in his songwriting career.&nbsp;</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/011/25b/4af2b267f92bb25a20bb501eacff1106b7-09-elvis-costello-cover.w250.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-4-0-0@published data-word-count=4><strong>Chapter 13: Unfaithful Music</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-5-0-0@published data-word-count=44>I’ve always told people that I wrote the song “Alison” after seeing a beautiful checkout girl at the local supermarket.

The building had replaced an old Odeon cinema to which the nuns had inexplicably taken us to see a garish, color newsreel about the Royal Family one Commonwealth Day afternoon in the early ’60s.

About once every four or five weeks, I might save enough money to buy a record.

There were a lot of raised voices and slammed doors for a confined space containing an infant. The girl emerged with her face flushed, eyes wet with tears, and a welt on her cheek. Another time, the lad brushed by me in the hall, heading furiously for the door, having clearly received a well-deserved right-hander.

My cues came from some distance, certainly a mile away from present fashions and the hit parade.

The title was a play on words, employing the Welsh “Good night” —&nbsp;<i>Nos da&nbsp;</i>— with which my mother sometimes bade me to sleep as a child, having learned it from our landlady in Olympia. It concluded:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-27-0-0@published data-word-count=16><i>I</i><i>f there’s one thing that’s worse than being lost<br></i><i>I</i><i>t</i><i>’</i><i>s</i><i> </i><i>knowing </i><i>y</i><i>o</i><i>u</i><i>’</i><i>r</i><i>e</i><i> </i><i>so close </i><i>to being found</i></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-28-0-0@published data-word-count=39>The mood of these songs was hushed, as befitted songs written when a child was sleeping, &nbsp;but not all of my songs were written to be sung, in Joni Mitchell’s memorable phrase, “to the sound hole and your knee.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-29-0-0@published data-word-count=48>I wrote a country two-step barroom scene called “Cheap Reward” that contained the line “Lip service is all you’ll ever get from me,” which would eventually find its way into an Attractions song of that name in 1977.

I would send my lyrics to myself by registered mail, leaving the envelope unopened so that I could prove authorship, should anyone try to steal my songs. I kept a note of the contents of each tape in a little notebook. For some reason, I thought A&M might respond to a version of “Radio Radio” called “Radio Soul” and the first draft of “Living in Paradise,” but I didn’t send either of these songs to Charlie.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-37-0-0@published data-word-count=15>Whatever the reasoning, I soon got word that the tape was going to be broadcast.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-38-0-0@published data-word-count=73>When that moment came, I went into the kitchen and turned out all the lights. I didn’t want anyone to see me listening to my own voice coming out of the transistor radio. The only illumination came from a streetlamp outside the ground-floor window, which cast a vague glow along the linoleum. I was just one storey below where I’d sat as a child, listening to my Dad rehearse for his radio broadcasts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-39-0-0@published data-word-count=41>My voice sounded lower and older than I’d imagined, but I was still finding a way to sing, and the performance was still full of strange affectations, just not all of the strange affectations with which I eventually made my name.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-40-0-0@published data-word-count=24>Charlie was complimentary enough about the song, in his deadpan way, but then they went to the weather forecast and the spell was broken.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-41-0-0@published data-word-count=28>The world didn’t stop turning, the sky didn’t fall in, and I wondered if there was even more than a handful of listeners tuned in at that hour.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-42-0-0@published data-word-count=35>Over the next few weeks, a couple more songs were aired on the show, but still no limousine pulled up outside to dispatch a cigar-chomping impresario to my door with promises of acclaim and riches.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-43-0-0@published data-word-count=71>There was briefly a vague plan to issue one of the songs on Oval, the small independent label that Charlie ran. Oval had licensed Johnnie Allen’s Louisiana recording of “Promised Land” with some minor success and would soon issue the first version of “Sultans of Swing” by Dire Straits, another unsigned act of the day, but the scheme for me to be recorded was eventually overtaken by other more urgent overtures.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4de835ced9deea103d3461db120a33be-44-0-0@published data-word-count=38>Unable to make our rent, we moved in with my in-laws for a while, until their dog started to chew its way through our record collection stuffed under the bed.
