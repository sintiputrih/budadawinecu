She is an actress and producer, perhaps best known for appearing in the long-running television show called “Grey’s Anatomy”, and also for acting in such movies as “Daredevil”, “Moonlight Mile”, “Undermind” among others. During her career, Ellen has been nominated for and has won numerous awards. Some of them include Satellite Award, Golden Globe Award, Teen Choice Award, People’s Choice Award and others. As she is also trying to build up a career as a producer, there is a high chance that she will become acclaimed not only as an actress.</p><p>So how rich is Ellen Pompeo? It is estimated that Ellen’s net worth is over $30 million. Ellen mainly gained this sum of money through her successful career in both the movie and television industries. If she will make her name as a producer, there is little doubt that this sum of money will become even higher.</p><h3>Ellen Pompeo Net Worth $30 Million</h3><p>Ellen’s career as an actress began in 1996, when she appeared in the television show entitled “Law & Order”. In 1999 she acted in her first movie, called “Coming Soon”, in which she had an opportunity to work with Bonnie Root, <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a>, <a href=#>Mia Farrow</a>, <a href=#>Gaby Hoffman</a> and others. This was the time when Pompeo’s net worth really began growing. Step by step Ellen’s popularity grew and she received more invitations to portray varying roles. She has appeared in such shows as “Strong Medicine”, “Friends”, “Strangers with Candy” and others. All these appearances added a lot to Pompeo’s net worth. In 2002 Ellen portrayed one of the lead roles in the movie called “Moonlight Mile”, which helped her gain more fans.</p><p>Three year later Pompeo was cast in one of the most famous television shows, called “Grey’s Anatomy”. During the filming of this show Ellen worked together with <a href=#>Sandra Oh</a>, <a href=#>Katherine Heigl</a>, <a href=#>Justin Chambers</a>, <a href=#>Kate Walsh</a>, <a href=#>Chandra Wilson</a> and others.

Other television shows and movies that Ellen has appeared in include “The Job”, “Repeat After Me”, “Get Real”, “Art Heist”, “Life of the Party” and others. In 2014 Ellen announced that she is planning to end her career as an actress as soon as “Grey’s Anatomy” ended. Despite this fact, there is still a high chance that she will change her mind and will continue appearing in various shows and movies.</p><p>If to talk about Ellen Pompeo’s personal life, it can be said that in 2007 she married <a href=#>Chris Ivery</a> and they have two children. All in all, Ellen is a beautiful and very talented woman, who has portrayed various roles during her career and has achieved a lot.
