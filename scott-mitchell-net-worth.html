His career was active from 1990 to 2001; he also worked as a coach.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Scott Mitchell is, as of mid-2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Scott’s net worth is over $10 million, accumulated not only through his involvement in the sports industry as a professional football player, but also as a football coach.</p><h3>Scott Mitchell Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Scott Mitchell spent his childhood in his hometown, attending Springville High School, where he began to play football. Upon matriculation, he enrolled at the University of Utah and played for the college team – the Utah Utes, distinguishing himself as a player.</p><p>In no time, Scott’s professional playing career began, when he was selected in the 1990 NFL Draft as the 93rd overall pick in the fourth round by the Miami Dolphins, so he signed a rookie contract, which marked the beginning of his net worth. He served as Dan Marino’s back-up for the next three years, until Dan was injured, so Scott was moved to the position of starting quarterback in 1993.</p><p>However, in the following season Scott became a part of the Detroit Lions, signing a contract with the team as a free agent, which added a considerable amount to his net worth. Unfortunately, he suffered an injury in the game against the Green Bay Packers, so he was replaced by <a href=#>Dave Krieg</a>. Nevertheless, during the 1995-1996 season, he played again and set records not only for passing yards (4,338), but also for touchdown passes (32). Since then, he has not had any major success, except that he appeared in the NFL playoffs in 1995 and 1997.</p><p>In 1999, Scott became a member of the Baltimore Ravens, after which he played for the Cincinnati Bengals from 2000 until 2001. He finished his professional playing career with 15,692 passing yards.</p><p>Apart from his career in the NFL, Scott also played football in the World League of American Football for the Orlando Thunder in 1992, increasing further his net worth.</p><p>After retirement, Scott decided to stay in the sports industry as a football coach. In 2008, he was named the head coach of his alma mater Springville High School team. Four years later, he quit the job as he moved his focus to the business industry.</p><p>When it comes to speak about Scott Mitchell’s personal life, there in no information about it, except that he is married to Wendy. He is known for struggling with his weight, being 366 pounds (166 kg) in 2014, and then appearing in the reality TV show “The Biggest Loser: Glory Days”, on which he lost 120 pounds (54 kg).</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=5.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Tied with Rodney Peete for 99th on NFL All-Time Passing Attempts List (2,346).</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Holds Detroit Lions single-season record for passing yards.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>3</td><td>Former NFL quarterback with Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, Baltimore Ravens, and Cincinnati Bengals.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</td><td>1994</td><td></td><td>Miami Dolphin Team Player</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=11><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Biggest Loser</td><td>2014-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Contestant / Himself - Eliminated Contestant</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Entertainment Tonight</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - The Biggest Loser</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The NFL on CBS</td><td>2000</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Cincinnati Bengals Quarterback</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>ESPN's Sunday Night Football</td><td>1996-1997</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Detroit Lions Quarterback</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>NFL on FOX</td><td>1995-1997</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Detroit Lions Quarterback</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>NFL Monday Night Football</td><td>1993-1996</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Detroit Lions Quarterback / Himself - Miami Dolphins Quarterback</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The NFL on NBC</td><td>1996</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Detroit Lions Quarterback</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>TNT Sunday Night Football</td><td>1993</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Miami Dolphins Quarterback</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1301160_Scott-Mitchell/1301160_The-Biggest-Loser-20142015.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1301160_Scott-Mitchell/1301160_Ace-Ventura-Pet-Detective-1994.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1301160_Scott-Mitchell/1301160_NFL-Monday-Night-Football-19931996.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqyaqKykYrqqwMKhnKWkXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./today-savannah-guthrie-waves-goodbye-co-star-emotional-goodbye-from-nbc.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Today's Savannah Guthrie waves goodbye to co-star following emotional departure from NBC">&larr;
