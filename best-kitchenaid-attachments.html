My <a href=#>homemade pasta recipe</a> is my favorite cooking project, and this attachment makes working with the fresh pasta dough a breeze! Because it’s electric, it rolls and cuts the pasta SO much more quickly than a manual pasta maker would.</p><p>This KitchenAid attachment set includes 4 items: a stainless steel pasta roller, spaghetti cutter, and fettuccine cutter, plus a handy cleaning brush. I love the variety of pasta shapes you can make with the set—in addition to spaghetti and fettuccine, we’ve used sheets of fresh pasta to make <a href=#>ravioli</a> and lasagna! Overall, I highly recommend this attachment. It yields smooth, consistent pasta every time.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$149.95 at Amazon</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Dimensions: 9.7 by 3.8 by 2.2 inches</li><li>Components: Pasta roller, spaghetti and fettuccine cutter attachments, and cleaning brush</li><li>8 different thickness options</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Saves time when making fresh pasta</li><li>Option to make stuffed pasta with the pasta sheets</li><li>Yields consistent noodles every time</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Can be difficult to clean</li></ul><p><strong>What Others are Saying:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Wirecutter</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>America’s Test Kitchen</a> named it one of the best KitchenAid attachments.

They’re just so fun! I’ve tried a range of spiralizers over the years, and if you ask me, the KitchenAid Spiralizer Attachment is the best way to spiralize your favorite vegetables. With the power of the KitchenAid mixer behind it, it’s much faster and more powerful than other ones on the market. It easily cuts through everything from tender zucchini to tough sweet potatoes and butternut squash, which would require some serious elbow grease with a manual spiralizer.</p><p>Other great benefits of this attachment are that it can make “noodles” of different thicknesses and that it’s dishwasher safe. Use it to make <a href=#>veggie noodles</a> to add to <a href=#>bowls</a>, <a href=#>salads</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>soups</a>!</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$69.95 at Amazon</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Dimensions: 12.36 by 12.36 by 2.91 inches</li><li>Components: Five different blades, including peeling and coring</li><li>Storage case for blades</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>The blades are easy to store</li><li>Makes spiralizing easy</li><li>Skewer holds the item in place</li><li>Dishwasher safe</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Requires more setup than some other spiralizers</li><li>Pricier than some other spiralizers</li></ul><p><strong>What Others are Saying:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>SpruceEats</a> gave this attachment a very good rating, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Food & Wine</a> named it the best splurge in its roundup of spiralizers.

I like that it’s more compact to store than a standalone ice cream maker, and we’ve had a blast experimenting with different homemade ice cream flavors and mix-ins over the years. It makes fantastic traditional ice cream (see <a href=#>this homemade ice cream recipe!</a>), as well as <a href=#>vegan ice cream</a>, sorbet, and gelato.</p><p>Just remember to freeze the bowl for at least 12 hours before you get churning!</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$69.95 at Amazon</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Capacity: 2 quarts</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Connects to the stand mixer</li><li>Dasher incorporates mix-ins</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Makes ice cream in under 30 minutes</li><li>Bowl is easy to clean with warm soapy water</li><li>Easier to store than a standalone ice cream maker</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>None!

In this dish, thin sheets of sweet potato take the place of noodles. Cutting them can be very tedious to do by hand or with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mandoline</a>, but this powerful stand mixer attachment makes the vegetable prep safe and easy. Use it to make sheets of zucchini, apple, or other fruits and veggies for veggie lasagnas, plant-based wraps, casseroles, and desserts.</p><p>I love that this attachment can cut sheets to two different levels of thickness. It also never tears the produce, and all the parts are dishwasher safe.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$59.97 at Amazon</a><p><strong>The Specs:</strong></p><ul><li>Dimensions: 10.8 by 7.9 by 3 inches</li><li>Components: Two thickness blades</li><li>Includes carrying case</li></ul><p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Creates even sheets from oddly shaped vegetables</li><li>Easier to use than a mandoline</li><li>Dishwasher safe</li></ul><p><strong>The Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Harder to use with smaller vegetables like zucchini</li><li>One specific use</li></ul><p><strong>What Others are Saying:</strong></p><p>The KitchenAid Vegetable Sheet Cutter received a 4.6-star rating from more than 1,800 reviews on Amazon. <a href=# rel=noopener>Good Housekeeping</a> also named it one of the best KitchenAid attachments.</p><p><strong>Buy the KitchenAid Spiralizer Attachment:</strong></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$59.97 at Amazon</a><h2>Other KitchenAid Attachments to Consider</h2><p>I love all the KitchenAid attachments that I own. However, there are still a few that I have yet to add to my collection and others that don’t fit my cooking needs but would be great for someone else! These popular and highly rated attachments are worth checking out as well:</p><p><strong>Best for Bread Baking: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">KitchenAid Sifter + Scale Attachment</a></strong></p><p>I’ve seen the KitchenAid Sifter + Scale attachment in person and wish I had it when I was baking lots of bread at home a few years ago. It would have come in super handy for measuring ingredients for the dough. I’d recommend it for avid bakers to simplify measuring flour and other dry ingredients. <strong>The KitchenAid Sifter + Scale Attachment is available at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon for $99.99</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Best for Shredding: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">KitchenAid Fresh Prep Slicer/Shredder Attachment</a></strong></p><p>Love cheese but don’t want to grate it manually? The KitchenAid Fresh Prep Slicer/Shredder Attachment would be a great attachment for you, especially if you don’t own a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">food processor</a>. I usually grate by hand, but this attachment, which comes with three blades for shredding cheese and vegetables, would be a major timesaver if you’re cooking large quantities for meal prep or entertaining. It’s also quite affordable compared to other KitchenAid attachments. <strong>The KitchenAid Fresh Prep Slicer/Shredder Attachment is available at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon for $44.95</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>Best for Whole Grain Lovers: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">KitchenAid All Metal Grain Mill Attachment</a></strong></p><p>This KitchenAid attachment is for all the whole grain bakers out there. The KitchenAid All Metal Grain Mill grinds wheat, oats, corn, rice, and more into great homemade flours. You can adjust the texture to add some extra flair to baked goods and breads. Just note it can be a little loud. <strong>The KitchenAid All Metal Grain Mill Attachment is available at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon for $114.95</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>Best for Summertime: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">KitchenAid Shave Ice Attachment</a></strong></p><p>Hello, summer! The KitchenAid Shave Ice Attachment is new to the KitchenAid lineup, and it’s on my list to try ASAP. You can use it to make shaved ice for dessert or add crushed ice to drinks, and you can add syrups, coffee, and more directly into the attachment. It would be a great addition to any backyard party! <strong>The KitchenAid Shave Ice Attachment is available at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon for $74.95</a>.</strong></p><h2>How I Tested The Best KitchenAid Attachments</h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-kitchenaid-attachments/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/KitchenAid-Attachement.jpg&description=The+4+Best+KitchenAid+Attachments+of+2023")'></span></span></p><p>I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, and my KitchenAid stand mixer is always on the counter.
