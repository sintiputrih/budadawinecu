Let's have a look at what we know about Levon's personal and professional life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=levon-thurman-hawke-had-a-cameo-in-stranger-things><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Levon Thurman-Hawke Had A Cameo In Stranger Things</span></h2><p>While Stranger Things may be his sister's show, Levon, too, made an appearance in a blink-and-you-ll-miss-it moment in season four.</p><p>But let's go back to how it all started. In 2019, his sister Maya debuted as fan-favorite character Robin Buckley in season three of <a href=#>the sci-fi show created by the Duffer brothers</a>.</p><p>When Maya returned for season four, Levon was brought on board for a small role. Don't fret if you can't remember him as he only appears for a moment in a scene between Robin and Steve (Joe Keery).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Eleven’s Fashion Evolution On Stranger Things Means For The Character</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a shift at the video store, the two besties are talking about their relationship with women, with Steve insisting he's nice to all customers, not just the ones he likes. As he says that, Levon appears in the background in full punk attire: spiky hair, smokey eye makeup and a ton of safety pins on his denim jacket.</p><p>He enters the video store and takes a look around, only to never reappear again. Will we see more of Levon's mysterious character in season five? There hasn't been an official confirmation yet, but better keep your eyes peeled for more cameos when the new installment is out.</p><h2 id=ethan-hawke-made-levon-switch-seats-to-sit-next-to-rihanna><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ethan Hawke Made Levon Switch Seats To Sit Next To Rihanna</span></h2><p>In 2015, Levon was the protagonist of a hilarious incident with his dad Ethan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An avid sports fan, Levon attended an NBA All-Star game, sitting courtside with his famous father. Next to them, singer and entrepreneur Rihanna was also watching the game. Pictures from the game documented that Ethan asked Levon, then 13, to switch seats so he could sit next to the Umbrella singer.</p><p>The Black Phone star seven rehashed the embarrassing moment in 2019, taking to his Instagram.</p><p>"Yes, my son and I remember this GREAT night. His version is a little different than mine," Ethan joked, including pictures of the incident.</p><h2 id=maya-hawke-wanted-levon-to-appear-in-her-music-video><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Maya Hawke Wanted Levon To Appear In Her Music Video</span></h2><p>As Levon is a guitarist, it was only natural for him and his sister Maya — who is a singer — to collaborate at some point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two have performed together on several occasions (their Instagram accounts are proof), but Maya also asked Levon to star in the music video for one of her songs, Thérèse.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Maya Hawke Is Turning Heads In A New Way (With Her New Music)</a></span></p><p>Directed by Brady Corber, the NSFW video follows Levon as he drives towards an unknown destination, before a different scene reveals his sister making out with a woman. The clip then focuses on several bodies intertwined as the characters get intimate with one another in a forest before they are rumbled by the police. We can't link it up here for obvious reasons, but you should check it out.</p><h2 id=levon-roan-thurman-hawke-will-star-opposite-tom-holland><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Levon Roan Thurman-Hawke Will Star Opposite Tom Holland</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stranger Things wasn't Levon's first foray into acting.

But she soon realizes that something sinister is at play beneath this perfect surface, and will need to get to the bottom of it to make it out alive.</p><h2 id=levon-thurman-hawke-has-a-great-relationship-with-his-siblings><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Levon Thurman-Hawke Has A Great Relationship With His Siblings</span></h2><p>Levon <a href=#>isn't just close to his eldest sister Maya</a>, but is also a caring big brother to his two younger sisters, Clementine Jane and Indiana.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two girls are Ethan Hawke's daughters with his second wife, Ryan Shawhughes, who had briefly worked as his and Thurman's children's nanny.</p><p>Levon may be very private about his relationships, but is happy to post pictures with his two younger siblings as they do different activities: from having a swim to walking their dogs, with Maya often joining in the fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmo56un6N6s7vAp2StoKWnuqK6jKGYsKOVYrGwew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./richest-celebrities.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mike Rowe Net Worth  Multiple Income And Earning Sources">&larr;
