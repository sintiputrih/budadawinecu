The actor was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned about their break-up by GQ</a>, but only had positive things to say about his ex. “She's [Alyson] done a great job, and she's an incredible mother,” Barry said.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/barry-keoghan-banshees.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Truth About Oscar-Nominee Barry Keoghan's Tragic Childhood</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Barry Keoghan's career is booming, but his journey to the top wasn't the smoothest.</span><p>The U.K. native also gushed over their son, Brando, adding, “I can’t get the little boy off my mind.

The report also alleged Alyson was uncomfortable with how close Barry had grown to their nurse.</p><p>“They’ve grown apart over recent months and things have finally come to a head,” the source alleged. “His partying caused arguments.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Alyson also suspects he has got close to someone else and is adamant there is no going back,” they went on. “As far as she’s concerned, it’s over.”</p><p>For now, Barry hasn’t addressed the allegations that he was asked to leave the Irish hotel. However, he has made it clear he’s moving on from his relationship, even if the dust has just settled. Barry has been seen hanging out with Sabrina Carpenter, who some fans have noticed has an uncanny resemblance to Alyson.</p><p>"It definitely seemed like a date,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider told PEOPLE</a> after spotting Barry and Sabrina on a date night, noting the pair weren’t afraid to engage in PDA in front of onlookers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmqqirnqssc6gn5qmXaiwprrEZp%2BorJWheqO%2BzqScZq2gYrSqvsufqaKdnpl8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cheyna-matthews.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cheyna Matthews Stats, Goals, Records, Assists, Cups and more">&larr;
