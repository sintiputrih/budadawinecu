More recently, the franchise has taken television by storm since <a href=#>a fortune has been spent producing MCU shows</a> and <a href=#>several Marvel series have moved from Netflix to Disney+</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Marvel Characters Who Deserve Their Own Disney+ Show (And Why)</a></span></p><p>Now that several MCU shows have aired on Disney+, Marvel fans have begun to argue which one of them is the best. Since debates like that are subjective, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that every Disney+ MCU show has its lovers and haters. For example, some viewers absolutely love the show Loki and others think it belongs at the bottom of the heap. As it turns out, some of the people who belong to the latter group feel that way because they believe that Sophia Di Martino ruined Loki.</p><h2 id=why-some-marvel-cinematic-universe-fans-think-sophia-di-martino-ruined-loki>Why Some Marvel Cinematic Universe Fans Think Sophia Di Martino Ruined Loki</h2><p>Throughout most of history, people debated things in person. Thanks to the internet, however, there are loads of websites where people can go to debate the hottest subjects of the day. On the one hand, it is wonderful that when people have strong feelings on a subject, there is somewhere thay can go to hash them out. On the other hand, the internet sometimes allows the loudest people with the least popular opinions to have an oversized voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Owen Wilson Prepared For His Role In 'Loki'</a></span></p><p>In 2021, a Reddit user that goes by u/StretchyCoin went on the r/Loki subreddit to express their opinion that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophia Di Martino ruined the show Loki</a> in very diplomatic terms. “It could just be my opinion but I find Sophia di Martino's acting really bad, Tom hiddleston carries her so much please let me know if you think I'm wrong. She has a Yorkshire accent which is where I'm from and because not many actors have it, it kind of sounds weird when heard on the screen mabye that could be a contributing factor as to why I don't like her.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though it is interesting to read u/StretchyCoin’s take on Sophia Di Martino’s performance as the character Sylvie from the show Loki, one person’s opinion doesn’t necessarily mean much. However, it is important to note that at least 23 people upvoted u/StretchyCoin’s post. Of course, 23 upvotes may not seem like much at first glance. However, when you really think about it, that is significant.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Will Tom Hiddleston Do Now That The First Season Of 'Loki' Is Over?</a></span></p><p>Since the r/Loki subreddit doesn’t get much traffic, that means that only a small group of people got to see the post and vote on it. With that in mind, it seems very possible if more people got the chance to vote on the post that claims Sophia Di Martino ruined Loki, they would agree with the sentiment expressed in it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-lot-of-fans-love-sophia-di-martino-in-loki>A Lot Of Fans Love Sophia Di Martino In Loki</h2><p>Even though there clearly is a group of people who don’t appreciate Sophia Di Martino’s portrayal of Sylvie from the show Loki, many fans loved her in the role. In fact, when you look at u/StretchyCoin’s aforementioned post about Di Martino’s performance, the reply with the most upvotes has nothing but praise for the actor. “In my opinion, I thought she was awesome, especially the accent, and I love the way she says 'Loki'.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of random fans on Reddit defending Sophia Di Martino’s portrayal of Sylvie from the MCU show Loki, she received praise from professional reviewers too. For example, denofgeek.com’s Lacy Baugher wrote a Loki review with the subtitle “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophia Di Martino's prickly, ferocious Sylvie is the secret to Loki's success</a>”. While that is far from the only Loki review that heaped praise on Di Martino, it epitomizes how a lot of viewers felt about her performance as the character.</p><h2 id=how-sophia-di-martino-feels-about-portraying-sylvie>How Sophia Di Martino Feels About Portraying Sylvie</h2><p>Before Sophia Di Martino was hired to star in the MCU show Loki, she’d already spent years performing in a long list of TV shows and movies. Still, when Di Martino landed a major role in the top film and television franchise of all time, it is very safe to say that the pressure on her was nothing like anything she’d experienced in the past. Based on everything she has said about her role starring in Loki, it seems like Di Martino is very pleased to portray Sylvie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully for her, Sophia Di Martino made it clear that she takes a lot of pride in portraying Sylvie when she spoke to Esquire after the finale aired. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Di Martino is happy that she got to play a character that means a lot to people</a>. "The representation was super important for a lot of people, and it's great to be a part of that, finally." Similarly, in other interviews, Di Martino has expressed the fact that she loved playing Sylvie and that she would love to share the screen with other MCU stars. In fact, while speaking to Entertainment Tonight Canada, Di Martino said she wanted to see Sylvie go up against The Hulk.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Was Sophia Di Martino Known For Before 'Loki'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdorC2ecWapaxlpJ22r7eMrKapoJmWeqW1jKaYq6yZo7xuvtSipZ6cXaG8rLWO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./briar-rose-christensen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Briar Rose Christensen">&larr;
