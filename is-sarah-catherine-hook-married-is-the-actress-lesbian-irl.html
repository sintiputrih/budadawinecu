If that is the case, there is a new Netflix show around the corner we think you will like–First Kill. First Kill is Netflix’s first attempt at doing a lesbian vampire show and thus is one of the most anticipated shows this summer. It stars Sarah Catherine Hook (as a vampire) and Imani Lewis (as a vampire hunter) in the lead and both of them are ready to make their first kill. Things get tricky as both of them begin to fall for each other.</p><p>In this article, we will talk about Sarah Catherine Hook’s role in Netflix’s First Kill, her married life, net worth, family, and more.</p><h3><strong>Sarah Catherine Hook On Netflix’s First Kill</strong></h3><p>Actress Sarah Catherine Hook plays the role of Juliette Fairmont, a teenage vampire, on First Kill, which will premiere on Netflix on June 10th 2022.</p><p>Juliette is “a shy, kind teenage girl who was born a vampire and determined to not be a monster.” Sarah’s character description further reads: “Her family has always supported her, but as she comes into her own, her quest for love is challenged by her legacy.”</p><p>Based on a short story by V.E. Schwab, First Kill follows teenage vampire, Juliette Fairmont, who sets her sights on Calliope Burns, a new girl in town, when she is required to make her ‘first kill’ in order to take her rightful place among a powerful vampire. Little did Juliette realize that Calliope is actually a vampire hunter and hails from a family of powerful, celebrated slayers. For Calliope’s part, she is also required to make her first kill. Things get tricky when these two people who are supposed to kill each other fall in love with each other.</p><p>Sarah Catherine Hook joined the cast of Netflix’s YA vampire series in early 2021. Sharing a screenshot of Deadline’s article, she announced her part in the show. On the caption side, she wrote, “not many words…just a whole lotta gratitude !!!! ☺️🙏😭❣️thank you to every single human who got me here.”</p><p>In an interview with geekgirlauthority.com, Sarah revealed some details from her audition for the part of Juliette. She shared that when she got the audition, she did not think she would even be considered for the role of Juliette since the physical description of the character was very different from who she was. Fortunately, she got the part and with every additional audition her love for Juliette increased, she told.</p><p>Recently, on May 12th, Sarah also shared the trailer of First Kill on her IG. She wrote, “‘Scuse me while I weep into a puddle…..FIRST KILL TRAILER HAS OFFICIALLY ARRIVED !!!!!!!,” in the caption.</p><h3><strong>Is Sarah Catherine Hook Lesbian IRL?</strong></h3><p>Netflix’s First Kill will see Sarah Catherine Hook do lesbian romance with her co-star Imani Lewis. But, is she lesbian in real life? Probably not.</p><p>According to famousbirthdays.com, Sarah was allegedly dating a man named Phil (full name: Phillip Laskaris). Therefore, we doubt she is a lesbian IRL.</p><h3><strong>Is Sarah Catherine Hook Married?</strong></h3><p>According to Sarah Catherine Hook’s alleged boyfriend’s Facebook, Phillip Laskaris worked at Frost Valley YMCA and studied at Purchase College, SUNY. Originally from Brooklyn, New York, Phil went to Poly Prep Country Day School.</p><p>Sarah has featured her man, Phil, a couple of times on her Instagram.
