KaMillion Alja Jackson and Aida Osman portray these roles and one of these actresses, i.e. KaMillion, we shall discuss in this writing called ‘KaMillion Alja Jackson’.</p><h3><strong>KaMillion Alja Jackson On HBO Max’s Rap Sh!t</strong></h3><p>The show follows KaMillion as Mia Knight and Shawna Clark, two estranged high school friends who come back together to form a rap group.</p><p>At present, Mia is a single mother and rapper working multiple jobs to support herself and her 4-year-old daughter, Melissa. The first episode sees Mia suggests she and Shawna start a rap group to change their situation.</p><p>Talking about it later, KaMillion shared that she has put a lot of herself into her role of Mia as she&nbsp;had some personal things going on at the time. She recalled how this situation help her deliver the character so well.</p><p>Plus, it also helped that she was already a real-life rapper. So, she had some one-liners here and there, but the acting was never something that she had been pursuing. And now, having done Rap Sh!t, she feels that she is just ready to be this breakout star that everybody loves.</p><p>But, though KaMillion denies that she has not had her big breakout moment yet, she already lived moments like opening the 2019 BET Hip Hop Awards with Lil Duval, or the one when her track “Twerk 4 Me” went viral on social media in 2020.</p><h3><strong>KaMillion Alja Jackson Net Worth</strong></h3><p>KaMillion Alja Jackson reportedly had less than $400K as her net worth as of 2022.</p><p>Known for her time on Love & Hip Hop: Miami, she went on to appear also in Joyful Noise, The Quad, and Star.
