First off, it is pretty obvious that since the movie-making industry is a business, the most important thing is whether or not fans are willing to spend their hard-earned money to see their films. On top of that, a lot of actors care deeply about gaining the respect of their peers. For example, it is a very big deal when someone wins an Oscar as they are the most respected awards in Hollywood in part because they are voted on by the people who work in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, even when someone has spent years trying to get something, that isn’t a guarantee that once you achieve that thing, it will be as great as you imagined. For example, winning awards may be a bit of a letdown so it is probably a good thing <a href=#>when an actor puts aside their Oscar-winning fantasies</a>. Unfortunately for Nicole Kidman, she has admitted that <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> is part of the reason why her experience following her Oscars win was so lonely.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Oscars Ban'</a></span></p><h2 id=an-amazing-career>An Amazing Career</h2><p>During Nicole Kidman’s truly impressive acting career, she has accomplished pretty much everything there is for a movie star to pull off. After all, Kidman has starred in many films that were highly successful at the box office including Aquaman, Happy Feet, Batman Forever, and Paddington among others. On top of that, Kidman is one of the most highly respected actors of her generation, let alone of all time. The reason for that is Kidman was spectacular in films like To Die For, The Beguiled, Eyes Wide Shut, Cold Mountain, Bombshell, and Paddington to name only a small sampling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of the fact that Kidman is an extremely talented actor, she has been nominated for many awards over the years. Most notably, Kidman has been nominated for an acting Oscar for her work in the films Moulin Rouge!, The Hours, Rabbit Hole, and Lion. While it truly is an honor to be nominated for an Oscar, Kidman has only taken home the highly coveted award one time and that was for her performance in The Hours.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Nicole Kidman Movie Are You, Based On Your Zodiac?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-alone>All Alone</h2><p>When Nicole Kidman won her Oscar in 2003, it had only been a couple of years since she got divorced from the acting superstar Tom Cruise. In the years since her first marriage came to an end, <a href=#>Kidman has notably avoided talking about Cruise</a>. Despite that, she has been willing to allude to the marriage ending during interviews in the past. For example, on a couple of occasions, Kidman has alluded to feeling extremely lonely following her Oscars win because of her divorce.</p><p>In 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Kidman talked about her lonely Oscars win</a> during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and she alluded to her divorce from Tom Cruise during the conversation. “When I won my Oscar, I was not in a great place in my life. I didn’t have a partner to share it with. I was flailing, emotionally and personally.” “I was alone. I sort of ordered some room service, and that was it, which I know is like, ‘Oh.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Nicole Kidman Didn't Attend Her Son's Wedding With Tom Cruise</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Earlier in 2015, Nicole Kidman also addressed feeling lonely following her Oscars win</a>. That time, she brought up the topic at the first Women in the World Summit in London. Unsurprisingly, Kidman’s description of the feelings she felt at that time was a lot more vivid than the way she talked about them during her appearance on a late-night comedy talk show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"To be completely honest, I was running from my life at that time. I wasn't able to handle the reality of my life and as an actor, you have this wonderful thing where you can go and get lost in somebody else's life and become somebody else for a period of time, and when I look back on it, I really see that." "Out of that came work that was applauded, so that was an interesting thing for me, because I was like, 'Ah.' So I then embraced my own life and I got myself together and it took me a number of years and during that time I worked a lot. The work was a great place for me to exist." "That [work] culminated in winning an Oscar and that caused an epiphany. I was sitting in the Beverly Hills Hotel [holding this gold statue] and it was all extraordinary and I was the loneliest I'd ever been."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Facts About Nicole Kidman And Tom Cruise's Marriage That Have Recently Surfaced</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilopufobJut8idpJqmXam8rnnCq6yiq5VisarCzquanmWnlsBuuM6nnKWxXZaztbHRZq6ipp6eu6h5x56pZqejmK6zedOopGaboqq2tLGO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./madison-gerhard-florida-dies-in-hit-and-run-accident.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Madison Gerhard Florida Dies in Hit And Run Accident-">&larr;
