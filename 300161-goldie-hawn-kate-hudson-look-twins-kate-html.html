She won a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for best supporting actress for her role in the classic film, "Cactus Flower."</p><p class=Zg>Meanwhile, Hudson won the hearts of millions of fans with her portrayal in the movie "Almost Famous." "You, Me, and Dupree," "Bride Wars," and "Fool's Gold" are among her most famous films.</p><p class=Zg>Not only has Hudson conquered the entertainment industry, but she has also established a name in the world of business.

The award-winning actress is close to her two sons, but she has a special bond with her only daughter.</p><p class=Zg>The pair have blown away fans with their closeness. They are an example not only of how a mother and daughter can share similar physical features but also of a wonderful upbringing with family values.</p><p class=Zg>Since Hudson's childhood, Hawn has believed in her and allowed her to be who she wants to beâ€” within their strong family relationship.</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>Kate Hudson's Childhood and Parenting Philosophy</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>Hudson had a wonderful childhood back in the day.
