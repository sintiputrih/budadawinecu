Heâ€™s anchored legendary franchises, has starred in hilarious commercials, and he even made a memorable appearance on <a href=#>Friends</a>. <a href=#>He might have missed out on some big opportunities</a>, but Willis' career is still the stuff of legend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, he's in a lot of B-movies, and <a href=#>fans think he's lost his enthusiasm for acting</a>. His role in Cosmic Sin is a recent example, but Willis still made bank for his time in the forgettable flick.</p><p>Let's take a look and see how much he made for the movie.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-bruce-willis-make-for-39-cosmic-sin-39>How Much Did Bruce Willis Make For 'Cosmic Sin'?</h2><p>During the height of his career, few movie stars on the planet were doing things bigger and better than Bruce Willis. He might have gotten his start on TV, but once he transitioned to the big screen, Willis became one of the most recognizable faces on the planet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor showed the world that he can thrive in different genres, but something truly spectacular took place when he was featured in action movies. Some people seem born for certain roles, and this certainly applies to Willis's time as John McClane in Die Hard franchise.</p><p>Of course, Willis has starred in other smash hits like Pulp Fiction, The Fifth Element, The Sixth Sense, Armageddon, Sin City, Unbreakable, too.</p><p>After years of tireless work in the movie industry, Willis has been able to achieve a massive net worth that anyone would be lucky to have.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Was Bruce Willis Paid For His Appearance On 'Friends'</a></span></p><h2 id=willis-made-millions-for-his-roles>Willis Made Millions For His Roles</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Bruce Willis is currently sitting on a $250 million fortune. Again, his acting career is what got him to this financial peak, and some of the check's that he's collected along the way are truly shocking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just how much was Willis making in his prime?</p><p>"His earnings from 1999's The Sixth Sense totaled $100 million thanks to a generous cut of the film's gross. His upfront salary was $14 million. As of this writing, that's the second-most money ever earned by one actor from a movie," writes Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>That's right, the actor snagged a 9-figure payday for a single movie, and believe us when we say that this was not the only time that he was paid a premium for his services.</p><p>The Die Hard films alone net him a ton of cash.</p><p>"He earned $5 million for the first Die Hard, $7.5 million for the second, $15 million for the third and $25 million for the fourth. In total, before even adjusting for inflation, Bruce has earned at least $52 million from the Die Hard franchise. After taking into account inflation, it's more like $70-80 million," Celebrity Net Worth reports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, this was back when Willis was still a thriving star. These days, he's past that point, and he's in small projects that don't get a lot of coverage. Despite this, he's still making millions.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bruce Willis Wasn't Making Any Sense During His BBC Interview On 'The One Show'</a></span></p><h2 id=willis-made-between-1-2-million-for-39-cosmic-sin-39>Willis Made Between $1-2 Million For 'Cosmic Sin'</h2><p>Currently, Bruce Willis is still making good money, but he is doing so in an unusual way. Willis has the name value to charge a premium for his services, but he does not stick around on set for long, and he seems intent on cranking out as many projects as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Make The Switch</a>, "The production on films like 'Cosmic Sin' revolves around the one or two days that Bruce shows up on set with zero enthusiasm, sleepwalks through the motions, and makes the production crew run themselves ragged so he can zoom in and out on his private jet."</p><p>"For a single day of work, Willis is paid $US1-2 million, the producers get to use his face on the poster (the one for 'Cosmic Sin' reuses old artwork from the marketing collateral for 'Die Hard 4') and the movie gains a degree of recognition. Clever producers make these kind of movies at a loss as a tax write-off," the site continued.</p><p>This is a pretty interesting peek behind the scenes, as it shows where Willis is at in his career. It also shows that smaller studios will make the investment just to get his name attached to a project. This, of course, is done with the hope of piquing the interest of casual viewers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bruce Willis Bags Exclusive Category In Razzies Nominations For 8 Bad Performances</a></span></p><p>Bruce Willis will forever remain a legend of the film industry, but at this point, he is not the major box office star he once was.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Bruce Willis Won't Shoot A Film With This Iconic Actor</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lkqfCpLGMsKClpJmoeq6typ5kn6eiYrCwv8yimmarmaN8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kendall-jenner-birkenstock-clogs-get-her-look-4640465.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kendall Jenners Birkenstock Clogs  Get Her Look Under $150  Hollywood Life">&larr;
