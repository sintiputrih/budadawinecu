The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have one of the smallest age gaps in the royal family being only <b>5 months apart</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-was-princess-diana-when-she-married></span>How old was Princess Diana when she married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>20 years old When Diana married Charles, she was just <b>20 years old</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-charles-date-dianas-older-sister></span>Did Charles Date Diana’s older sister?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>And some viewers will be surprised to learn that Diana’s eldest sister lady Sarah Spencer—born Elizabeth Sarah <b>Lavinia</b> Spencer in 1955—did in fact date Charles before Diana.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=at-what-age-diana-died></span>At what age Diana died?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>36&nbsp;years (1961–1997) Diana, Princess of Wales/Age at death Diana was <b>36 years old</b> when she died. Her death caused an unprecedented outpouring of public grief in the United Kingdom and worldwide, and her funeral was watched by an estimated 2.5 billion people. The Royal Family were criticised in the press for their reaction to Diana’s death.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-camilla-be-queen></span>Will Camilla be Queen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Despite Clarence House’s denial, <b>Camilla will automatically become Queen Consort when</b> Prince Charles ascends to the throne unless legislation is enacted by parliament to the contrary.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-camilla-parker-bowles></span>How old is Camilla Parker Bowles?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>74&nbsp;years (July 17, 1947) Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall/Age Today, she’s <b>73-years-old</b>.<p>Camilla Parker Bowles was born Camilla Rosemary Shand on July 17, 1947 in London, England.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-queen-elizabeth></span>How old is Queen Elizabeth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>95&nbsp;years (April 21, 1926) Queen Elizabeth/Age The <b>95-year-old</b> cancelled her appearance at the UN climate conference, which starts on Sunday in Scotland, a rare move for the workaholic monarch and all the more telling given her personal commitment to environmental issues.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-was-diana-a-princess-but-kate-is-not></span>Why was Diana a princess but Kate is not?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Neither Diana or Kate were <b>princesses at birth</b><p>Diana married into the royal family, and did receive a title from Queen Elizabeth, but it wasn’t Princess Diana. … Instead, it was the public that bestowed the title “Princess Diana” upon her and it stuck. Even Kate’s official royal name is not just the Duchess of Cambridge.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-was-diana-a-princess-but-not-camilla></span>Why was Diana a princess but not Camilla?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When Charles married Diana Spencer in 1981, she automatically became Princess of Wales. And while technically the title should have passed to Camilla Parker Bowles upon her wedding to Charles, <b>she turned it down out of respect to Diana</b> and is instead known as the Duchess of Cornwall.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-harry-have-to-bow-to-william></span>Does Harry have to bow to William?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Prince William will no longer have to curtsy to any members of the Royal Family once he ascends to the throne and becomes king. Under royal etiquette rules, this means his wife Kate, <b>the Duchess of Cambridge will only have to bow to her husband</b>, and will not have to curtsy to any senior figures within The Firm.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-dianas-coffin-lined-with-lead></span>Why is Diana’s coffin lined with lead?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Princess Diana’s coffin weighed a quarter of a tonne, due to the amount of lead lining. The lead makes the coffin airtight, <b>stopping any moisture from getting in</b>. This allows the body to be preserved for up to a year.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-diana-have-royal-blood></span>Does Diana have royal blood?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>So even though Prince Charles is a descendant of many years of royalty, Diana, Princess of Wales <b>had more English royal blood in her veins</b> than that of her husband or the Queen.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-name-will-charles-take-as-king></span>What name will Charles take as king?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>His full name is <b>Charles Philip Arthur George</b>, which means that as King, Charles can adopt any of the names in the full title. King Arthur, perhaps?<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-the-royal-vault-smell></span>Does the royal vault smell?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>After Markle made her request, the staff was left shocked because the chapel happens to be the regular place of worship for the Queen and it even contains the Royal Vault. “Apparently Meghan didn’t like the smell of the chapel, which as you would expect, is a <b>little musty</b>. It’s not unpleasant at all though.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-were-princess-diana-last-words></span>What were Princess Diana last words?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>He said that the princess asked him, <b>“My God, what has happened?</b>” It was only later that he found out the victim was Princess Diana, and that these would be her final words.

The vault was built in 1810 and George III was the first king to be interred there, in 1820.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-a-body-decompose-in-a-casket></span>How does a body decompose in a casket?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>By <b>50 years</b> in, your tissues will have liquefied and disappeared, leaving behind mummified skin and tendons. Eventually these too will disintegrate, and after 80 years in that coffin, your bones will break as the soft collagen inside them deteriorates, leaving nothing but the brittle mineral frame behind.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46wn5qsXayutHnToZxmmZeaeqW1xZ%2Bcq52emLJursStrp6dnmK9s7XNnJxmm5iWv62x0maYp5xdmbaiusBo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amy-schumer-deletes-post-making-fun-of-nicole-kidman-at-u-s-open.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amy Schumer Deletes Post Making Fun of Nicole Kidman at U.S. Open">&larr;
